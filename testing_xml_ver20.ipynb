The most effective way of seeing that the benefits of economic change are spread is to provide jobs for those Australians who do not now have them and who are looking for them. On that measure, this government's record has been quite outstanding. We have generated 596,400 jobs and, as of 1 July, there will be another very widely enjoyed benefit.

Even allowing for the recession which the Labor Party said we had to have, the average inflation rate under Laborincluding its recession yearswas 5.2 per cent.

Interestingly, this is a quarter where you would not normally expect an increase. It was the end of the year.

Firstly, I would like to make it clear that this government is strongly committed to the implementation of the criminal code. We look forward to seeing the completion of this process and a uniform application of the criminal code to a wide range of criminal offences. In 1995, the previous government set a relatively ambitious five-year target to review all offences under the Commonwealth law and amend them to meet the principles of the criminal code. Whilst there has been significant progress towards the development of a model criminal code, there are still aspects of chapter 2 relating to the general principles of criminal responsibility in relation to Commonwealth criminal offences that need to be reviewed. I know that all my colleagues agree that a project as important as the model criminal code needs to be thought out carefully and thoroughly implemented. It should not be rushed through, at any rate.

I am pleased that we can now proceed to make the necessary changes proposed in the amendments. Great progress has been made in the development of the model criminal code, and the overall task of developing and implementing the code has proven more extensive than originally anticipated. The bill defers the application of some parts of the Criminal Code Act to allow for all Commonwealth offences to be harmonised with the criminal code. When the code was originally enacted on 15 March 1995, the previous government estimated that it would take five years to review the many hundreds of existing Commonwealth offences to which the code was intended to apply. It has become clear that this estimate was too optimistic. Presently, chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act dealing with the general principles of criminal responsibility to apply to all Commonwealth criminal offences will come into effect on 16 March 2000. This bill defers that date of application to 15 December 2001. After that time the principles of the criminal code will generally apply to all offences under Commonwealth law. The development of the criminal code is a significant step in the evolution of our system of justice and it is important that it be implemented in a way that is considered and pays careful regard to the way Commonwealth offence provisions are to work in practice.']\n",

The first point that needs to be made is that we are living through a very substantial deterioration in the fiscal position of the Commonwealth, which was outlined in some detail in the recently released mid-year economic and financial outlook documents. What they showed for the forthcoming financial year of 2000-01 was an estimate that outlays would be almost $6 billion higher than was previously estimated and that revenue would increase by about only $3½ billiontherefore, a net deterioration in the overall position of the surplus of around $2½ billion. A similar deterioration can be seen in the out year of 2001-02, where the outlays are anticipated to increase by up to $6.6 billion and revenue is expected to increase by only $4.3 billion, and in the further out year of 2002-03, where outlays are expected to increase by $7 billion and revenue is expected to increase by only $5.5 billion.

I am sure that all of us feel a great deal of regret and sorrow over the death of any young people in Australia from suicide. But I want to speak on the broader issue tonight because our Constitution has given our states and territories the responsibility for making laws in regard to the issue of law and order. Australia is a very big country with vast regional differences, and the people in my state, Western Australia, have democratically elected the state government and called on that government to address a serious law and order issue of home burglary. In fact, Western Australia has the highest rate of reported home burglaries in Australia. It was as a result of the outcry by people of Western Australia that the Western Australian government took the measures that it did. Home burglary is a very serious offence, as it violates the sanctity of people's home and has a long-lasting effect which traumatises the victims, sometimes for many years after the event. It is not just the petty amount that is stolen but there are many women, older women in particular, who live alone and who are particularly traumatised by this kind of event. It is too prevalent in Western Australia. \"]\n",

We are reliably informed that the Prime Minister was moved by the experience. He was emotional. He was determined to do something about the removal and decline of services to the bush. The trouble with Mr Howard's new found interest in the bush is that wanting to do something about the drain of brains, businesses, services and population in regional Australia is not the same as doing it. What regional Australia is still experiencing is often the result of this government's policies, and they do not look like changing the menu. Promises are not matched with reality. Let us have a look at some examples. In the lead-up to the 1998 federal election, Treasurer Peter Costello promised that the GST would not lead to an increase in petrol prices. Now the promise has been watered down; it is limited and is conditional. That no conditions were imposed in 1998, that no limits were suggested and that no differentiation had been made between `core' and `non-core' promises seem not to worry Mr Costello. It is quite clear that the Treasurer's Sydney based price of 77c a litre for petrol means that in areas where the base price exceeds this there will be a price rise once the GST is imposed.\"]\n",

      "['by leaveCom-mon-wealth GBEs provide a range of services to the Australian community, including communications, transport, employment and health services. In 1998-99 Commonwealth GBEs generated revenues of nearly $25 billion, provided dividends of $4.5 billion and controlled assets of some $40 billion. Given that GBEs are publicly controlled entities, the parliament has a continuing interest in their governance, performance and accountability. The growing demand for more efficient, effective and responsible corporate governance stems from the corporate failures during the 1980s and 1990s. The focus on corporate governance, however, is driven not just by the corporate failures of the past but also by corporate challenges of the future. Corporations, both public and private, face challenges relating to globalisation, technological change and sustainable development.']\n",
      "['In view of these issues, the committee decided to review aspects of and ask questions about corporate governance and accountability arrangements applying to Commonwealth GBEs. The committee commenced this inquiry about two years after the government introduced new governance arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises in June 1997. The new governance arrangements focused on reporting arrangements, the appointment and removal of board directors, board responsibilities and financial governance arrangements. The broad objective of the inquiry is to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of these arrangements. The issues that the committee focused its investigation on, and which I will briefly discuss, include: (1) the appropriateness of the governance framework; (2) the role of the shareholder ministers; (3) GBE boards and performance appraisal; (4) the Senate estimates process and the scrutiny of GBEs; and (5) risk management issues.']\n",
      "['The committee examined the appropriateness of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and, in particular, its continued application to GBEs. Some groups suggested that it would be more effective for GBEs to be subject solely to Corporations Law. The primary objective of the CAC Act is to standardise the reporting, notification and auditing requirements of CAC bodies. In addition, it helps to ensure appropriate accountability to ministers and the parliament. As stated earlier, GBEs in 1998-99 generated revenues of nearly $25 billion, provided dividends of $4.5 billion and controlled assets of some $40 billion. In view of the significant responsibility in managing these assets, the committee is not prepared to recommend any relaxation of the accountability requirements applying to GBEs and supports the application of the CAC Act to GBEs. ']\n",
      "[\"The Commonwealth's ownership interests in its GBEs is represented in most cases by two shareholder ministers: the portfolio minister and the Minister for Finance and Administration. A key consideration during the inquiry was the perceived conflict that exists with the continuation of portfolio ministers as shareholder ministers. The government recognised this very fact when it chose to have the Minister for Finance and Administration as the sole shareholder for the Sydney Airports Corporation, Essendon Airport and Employment National. In these cases, the Department of Finance and Administration justified the sole shareholder model on the grounds that it would allow portfolio ministers to focus primarily on regulation and industry policy issues, and the Minister for Finance and Administration as shareholder to pursue the objective of value maximisation. It is essential that the operational settings for GBEs are such that they maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the entity and help generate appropriate rates of return. As suggested in the evidence, the influence of the portfolio minister could compromise these objectives. \"]\n",
      "[\"In view of these issues, the committee recommends that all portfolio ministers be removed from their GBE shareholder responsibilities but remain as the responsible minister under the GBE's enabling legislation. The government's shareholder interests in GBEs should be represented by and be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and Administration. A number of organisations have drawn attention to the fact that there are no principles relating to GBE performance to guide the relationship between ministers and boards. The committee notes that, in the event that the minister gives written directions to the boards of Telstra or Australia Post, these written directions must be tabled in both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days. In cases where ministers have the power to direct GBE boards, there is increased accountability and transparency if written directions are made public and subject to scrutiny. The committee concludes that in their relationship with ministers all GBE boards should be under a similar arrangement to Australia Post and Telstra. That is, all ministerial directions to GBE boards should be in writing and publicly reported.\"]\n",
      "[\"Boards of GBEs are responsible and accountable to shareholder ministers and parliament for delivering the government's policy objectives and ensuring that the enterprise is operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. It is essential that board directors be well equipped and informed to carry out their work. Therefore, the committee recommends that GBE boards must ensure that there are appropriate and effective induction, education and training programs offered to new and existing board directors. In addition, there is the need for greater attention to be given to the performance of the board and individual directors. Therefore, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance and Administration amend part 3 of the 1997 governance arrangements for Commonwealth GBEs to include a section requiring confidential board and director performance appraisal. A rigorous performance appraisal system in association with identified incentives will help develop a more competitive and performance oriented culture in GBE boards.\"]\n",
      "['A number of GBEs and portfolio departments made comments regarding the appropriateness of the Senate estimates process as an additional accountability mechanism. Telstra, in particular, indicated that appearing at Senate estimates hearings created an additional cost burden in terms of time and human resources devoted to this task. In addition, Telstra was concerned that questioning at Senate estimates could lead to the release of commercially sensitive information which could disadvantage it against its competitors. In view of these concerns, Telstra advised that it should be exempt from the Senate estimates process. The committee acknowledges some of the concerns that GBEs have about Senate estimates committees. While Telstra admitted that no commercially sensitive information has yet been released through Senate estimates committees, the risk remains that Telstra and other GBEs could be seriously disadvantaged in the marketplace if this were to occur. The committee suggests that there is the need for greater clarity and coherence in the way parliamentary committees examine commercial matters of GBEs. Therefore, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance and Administration develop draft guidelines for the scrutiny by parliamentary committees of commercially confidential issues relating to GBEs. The draft guidelines should be submitted to the committee for approval. ']\n",
      "[\"The government is exposed to many risks through its ownership of GBEs, including financial, operational, political and reputational risks. Therefore, the government considers it is essential to ensure that the risk management strategies of all Commonwealth GBEs are operating effectively. The board of a GBE is wholly responsible for identifying, monitoring and controlling all risks that may affect the operations of a GBE. Audit committees are playing an increasingly important role in corporate governance and, more specifically, in the area of risk management. The committee notes that Telstra's internal audit function is conducting a risk management assessment function. The Australian National Audit Office, in its better practice guide, proposed that audit committees should have a role in risk management, including approving and monitoring policies for reporting risk management and internal control. The 1997 governance arrangements devote a section to managing risks, although there is no mention of the role of audit committees in this process. The committee therefore recommends that the risk management responsibilities of audit committees be included in the governance arrangements for Commonwealth GBEs under part 4, `Managing risk'.\"]\n",
      "[\"In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. Finally, I wish to thank the members of the sectional committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat staff who were involved in the inquiry: the secretary to the committee, Margot Kerley; sectional committee secretary Stephen Boyd; research officer Mr Gordon Carey; and administrative officer Tiana Gray. I commend the report to the House.\"]\n",

      "[\"There was some suggestion in the course of this inquiry that government enterprises should not be subject to any greater scrutiny or requirements than those prescribed under the Corporations Law. There was also a view that, with the Howard government's ongoing process of privatisation, they are an endangered species and it would not be many years before this subject was rendered irrelevant by the extinction of the Commonwealth government business enterprise species. Indeed, since this inquiry was completed, the number of remaining GBEs has been reduced from 14 to 13 with the sale of ADI.\"]\n",
      "['The Labor Party does not accept that all existing GBEs will be sold or indeed that a future government will not occasionally have good reason to create new ones. The significance of some of the GBEs which remain, particularly Telstra and Australia Post, makes issues which go to their good management and accountability critical to both their financial performance and the delivery of community service obligations. If a partially privatised entity like Telstra finds itself in a schizophrenic situation, with private sector shareholders and a parliament interested in scrutinising its activities on account of not only its interest in the delivery of its services to the community but also its accountability to the Commonwealth as a majority shareholder, then that requires processes which are for the parliament to determine in a disciplined way and are not something to be left to Telstra. Indeed, on the day Telstra suggested to the committee that it should not be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny, the Commonwealth shares had a market value of $65 billion.']\n",
      "[\"The disciplined process to managing the Commonwealth's control of its GBEs began in October 1987 with the publication by the Labor government of the white paper policy guidelines for Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises. I am pleased to say, as the former senior private secretary to the minister for finance who was responsible for that white paper, that, on the basis of the report we are tabling today, the principles contained in that white paper stand up very well. I will go through the recommendations of this report in order, leaving the discussion of the recommendations on the applicability of administrative law to my colleague the member for Lalor. \"]\n",
      "[\"The committee proposes some clarification of the responsibilities of shareholder ministers and ministers responsible for GBEs under enabling legislation. Put simply, the perceived conflict between shareholder and operational issues can be resolved by making the Minister for Finance and Administration the single shareholder while making the relevant portfolio minister responsible for the powers of direction under the GBE enabling legislation. In reality, any significant conflict between these two ministers' positions on a major issue would be likely to be settled by cabinet.\"]\n",
      "['The 1987 white paper proposed that all GBEs be subject to a power of ministerial direction. This report recommends that, for reasons of transparency, where it is not already a requirement, any use of that power be in writing and be tabled in parliament within 15 days. To improve the quality of GBE boards, there should be appropriate induction, education and training programs, and board members should be subject to confidential board and director performance appraisal. Since one of the principal functions of boards is to manage risk within the organisation, board members should be both capable of doing this and, in the first instance, be in a better position to do it than portfolio departments maintaining a watching brief. GBE audit committees should be given specific responsibilities in this area. ']\n",
      "[\"Appearing before committees of the parliament was something that some GBEs, particularly Telstra, wanted to avoid. The committee found that the real cost of this process to the organisation is insignificant and that it should continue. However, in a competitive environment issues will arise that a GBE will want to keep confidential for commercial reasons. With care, these issues should be capable of being handled without compromising either the principles of parliamentary accountability or the GBE's commercial interests. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is the proposed shareholder minister, draw up an appropriate set of draft guidelines for the scrutiny by parliamentary committees of commercially confidential issues and that these be submitted to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit for its approval.\"]\n",
      "#######\n",
      "[\"by leaveI commend to the House the tabling of report No. 372, Corporate governance and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises, or GBEs as they are known, by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. I would also like to take this opportunity to emphasise the importance of the effective corporate governance and accountability practices in all of the federal government's business enterprises. As our chairman said, it is significant that in the 1998-99 financial year Commonwealth GBEs generated nearly $25 billion in revenue and $4.5 billion in dividends as well as controlling assets worth around $40 billionlarge amounts of money, even by federal government standards.\"]\n",
      "[\"What is more significant, though, is that these GBEs, including 14 organisations such as Australia Post, Telstra, the Defence Housing Authority, ADI, the Australian Rail Track Corporation and more, are controlled by the Australian government on behalf of the Australian people. My views on government business ownership and administration are well known. I believe that governments should remain in the business of running the country without dabbling in the business of running companies. I have stated before, for instance, that I support the proposal for the full sale of Telstra provided, and only provided, the federal government legally enforces the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations to regional Australia and ensures they are subject to independent performance audits; fully delivers the promised $671 million infrastructure improvements resulting from the first and second tranche sales; enforces community service standards in country and regional areas by further legislation; and legislates to suspend Telstra contracts if service obligations are not continually honoured.\"]\n",
      "['However, while ever the Australian government remains as it does in the business of running and administering business enterprises, GBEs run on behalf of the Australian people, I strongly support the need for an even higher standard of corporate governance and accountability practices to be developed and maintained. I believe that, while ever these assets are administered by the government, they should be maintained and improved as if they were the domain of private enterprise. This includes the maintenance of GBE infrastructure, keeping a strong, well-trained work force, good corporate governance and accountability practices and all those other facets that go into making a successful business, public or private. ']\n",
      "['My point is that government corporate governance and accountability plans and strategies need to be kept to a level comparable to, or even better than, that of private companies, with advice from private business, in order for our government enterprises to maintain their competitiveness in the ever-changing, fast-moving world market that we face in the year 2000 and beyond. If these levels are not maintained we will end up with devalued assets, of little use to us to maintain as GBEs or to sell. To me it is quite simple: regardless of your views on government business enterprises, it must be agreed that good corporate governance practices are required as an essential ingredient in their overall running. That is what this report is about.']\n",
      "['After the committee having conducted a public inquiry and investigating and carefully considering submissions from GBEs, government departments and other organisations, this report has been put together and presented with recommendations to improve the corporate governance and accountability practices within GBEs. With sensible recommendations, including the removal of portfolio ministers from GBE shareholder responsibilities while remaining as the responsible ministers, as well as several other recommendations for the Minister for Finance and Administration to consider, I am confident that the tabling of this report is a step in the right direction for the future good management of our GBEs. I again commend the tabling of the report.']\n",
      "#######\n",
      "['I rise to speak on the report Corporate governance and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises. This is an important report on an important area. As other speakers have noted, the area of government business enterprise is important not only because it has some $40 billion worth of assets in its hands but because it raises important matters of principle. In formulating this report, the committee had to wrestle with the question of what transparency and accountability requirements are appropriate for government business enterprises. Of course, in dealing with that question, there is a tension between two possible policy goals. One is that, in any situation where public funds are invested, the most transparent and accountable arrangement possible should be preferred. ']\n",
      "['As a matter of principle, taxpayers are entitled to know how assets in which they effectively hold a share are being managed. Weighing against that important public policy goal is the fact that a number of government business enterprises are competing against private sector firms. The government business enterprises are entitled to say that they should be subject only to the same transparency and accountability requirements as their private sector competitors and that, if they are required to meet a greater standard, they are not on a truly competitive footing. In resolving this tension, it is important to note that we are not dealing with a static background, and I believe that the member who spoke before me noted this as well. Increasingly, through globalisation, heightened competition and new technology, the demands on the private sector for accountability and transparency have increased. Global capital, with its increased mobility, has shown throughout the past decade that it is attracted to investments in those companies and those markets whose economic performance can be clearly assessed through transparent and accountable arrangements, and that it will increasingly spurn companies and markets whose hallmarks are secrecy and cronyism. We can therefore expect to see a global move to increasingly transparent and accountable arrangements, and we will need to keep pace in our domestic markets as these developments emerge. At the same time, within Australia we have seen the development of a culture of genuine inquiry amongst domestic shareholdersso-called mum and dad investorsabout the performance of companies in which they invest. We should expect this culture to become increasingly robust over the coming years, with increased activity by shareholders associations and the like to ensure that the funds that private citizens have put into private sector businesses are being managed in an appropriate way. ']\n",
      "[\"Consequently, the committee faced a policy conundrum about managing the tension between accountability for government business enterprises on the one hand and market competitiveness on the other. It is a policy conundrum against a background where the private sector itself is being increasingly required to deliver more accountable and transparent arrangements. In my view, it therefore would not be appropriate for us to relax the transparency and accountability arrangements that apply to government business enterprises to the level currently applying to the private sector. Indeed, I think we can rightly forecast that the level applying to the private sector will increase over time. Given this, it is important that the government should lead in this area. Its accountability and transparency arrangements should be better than those of the private sector and should not be allowed to devolve to the current accountability and transparency arrangements in the private sector. As people read this important report, they will get that flavour from the committee's consideration.\"]\n",
      "['I turn specifically, against that background, to make a few comments on recommendation 1, that being the applicability of administrative law to current and future government business enterprises. The committee has recommended that the Minister for Finance and Administration review the applicability of administrative law to current and future government business enterprises on a case by case basis. As I am sure we are aware in this place, there are a number of administrative law acts which apply to government business enterprises. They include the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the Ombudsman Act, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. There was, of course, a body of opinion that the administrative law requirements of each of these acts should be removed from government business enterprises, and indeed Telstra agitated for the case that that be done. Having said that, the other government business enterprises that appeared before the committee noted that the burden placed upon them of complying with the various administrative law arrangements which applied to them was not a particularly onerous one.']\n",
      "['Consequently, and in furtherance of the need for the greatest possible transparency and accountability, the committee has recommended in future that, for government business enterprises, the applicability of each of these aspects of administrative law should be reviewed by the minister on a case by case basis. It is my view that the minister, when making the decision as to which of these should apply, should err on the side of increasing transparency and accountability rather than on the side of not so increasing transparency and accountability. I believe that that is the flavour of the report overall. Of course, the case by case recommendation would require the minister to take into account the market that those GBEs find themselves in and what, if any, competitive disadvantage the applicability of such administrative law arrangements would have on those government business enterprises. Let me conclude by saying that I think this is an important report and an important area.

The Inspector is an integral part of the anti-corruption scheme set up under the NSW legislation but is technically a statutory entity separate from the commission itself.

As all honourable members would know, this series of bills is at the heart of how government runs itself and offers assistance to other levels of government through financial assistance grants and the application of federally collected taxpayers' moneys to projects that service us every day in so many different ways. With the introduction of the new tax system starting on 1 July, more Australians will have more money as a result of the changes to personal income tax rates reducing the level of personal income tax. Not only will pensioners and other recipients of welfare receive an increase in their pension from the Commonwealth of four per centwith people on rent assistance getting seven per centand also the other benefits that will come their way as a result of the new tax system but state governments and their adjuncts, their local authorities, will also receive a guaranteed source of income through the proceeds of the goods and services tax. \"]\n",

It is particularly good news for those who rely on state governments to provide a ready source of consistent revenue for important projects. People in my community, like those in the communities of all honourable members, have an expectation that state governments do not baulk at providing the right resources for law and orderthe provision of policefor hospitals and hospital services, for ambulances and fire brigades and of course for local governments to make sure, especially in the case of my electorate where the local government provides a bus service, that their services are reliable, timely and responsive to the needs of the local community. So, for these sorts of reasons, this debate always lends itself to the opportunity to talk about a variety of things that are not often talked about in this place. But the matters I want to raise are important. They are issues that affect people in the constituency that I am honoured to represent. The people of Moreton are concerned about not only the issues of expenditure and the decision making that brings about that expenditure but also the style of decision makingthe lack of consultation and the take you for granted approachof both the Brisbane City Council and the state government of Queensland.']\n",
      "['I want to deal particularly with the Brisbane City Council in this debate today because, unlike the state government of Queenslandwhich still does not quite have the high standards this federal government has as far as transparency and accountability are concernedit really does not have full exposure of its decision making processes, at least in the expenditure of its moneys, which total a budget greater than the budget of the entire state of Tasmania. As a federal member in a metropolitan electorate, it seems extraordinary to me that we have reached such a parlous state in the city of Brisbane, through the lack of consultation of the council that we have to suffer, that I have to deal with cracked footpaths, with blocked sewerage mains and with substantial issues such as poor bus routes in my electorate. I am never afraid to deal with those issues that are of importance to the people in my community because I think that my job is a constant activity testthat people in my electorate constantly expect me to be busy on their behalf, to get results and to advocate for them on matters that are of concern to them. It is for those sorts of reasons that I raise matters such as the 116 bus route, which comes through from Rocklea and Moorooka and makes its way through Clifton Hill and Annerley and into the city of Brisbane.']\n",
      "[\"In the last 12 months, the Brisbane City Council have embarked upon a change to bus routes. Some win, some lose every time there is change like that, and I guess that is a statement of fact. But what is extraordinary is the way the decisions to change the bus routes were made. The style of consultation involved sending out complicated paperwork days before Christmas, expecting people to offer a response to this survey mechanism at a busy time of year and, moreover, not disclosing to the people that this, depending on which way they responded, was going to affect whether or not they were going to keep the bus route. As a result, we have ended up with a lot of very angry people, particularly in and around Moorooka. In that area of Moorooka, there is a strip of shops on Beaudesert Roadthe Moorvale shopping strip—which is suffering as a direct result of this council's failure to properly consult and negotiate with local people about what is important to them.\"]\n",
      "[\"Local businesses are amazed at the conduct of the local Labor councillor, who is the incumbent in what is a very safe ward for him and who is taking his area for granted. His approach is, `Look, I am unable to return every phone call.' In fact, at a public meeting held a couple of weeks ago, he said, `I get 80 phone calls a day'which I think is an extraordinary number of phone calls`and I only have time to answer about 15.' That is about one in six. Is it any wonder that the majority of people in his area are upset with his style and complete lack of substance? So he is unable to return every telephone call. He now says that, because I have raised the issue of bus routes, I have made it political and he asks why I did not raise this a year ago. I thought that someone earning a wage just about as substantial as that of a federal parliament member might have been doing his job. If Brisbane City councillors, the Labor councillors, are not prepared to do their jobs, then here I am, a federal member of parliament, having to do it for them. That I have had to convene a public meeting to try to air the matters that should have been disclosed and found out by the Brisbane City Council is an absolute disgrace and a true indictment of the councillor concerned. \"]\n",
      "['But matters have been made worse. Not only has this councillor embarked upon this but his lord mayor has taken to ringing up elderly ladies who write letters to the editor complaining about the failure to get a right bus route in place and abusing the council. We have a Lord Mayor of Brisbane in charge of a budget bigger than that of the state of Tasmania who takes it upon himself to abuse old ladies. He takes it upon himself to abuse pastors of the Baptist Church and their wives. So the Lord Mayor of Brisbane is an elder abuser. What is particularly sad is that these matters are well understood by members of the media in Brisbane. They themselves have been on the receiving end of the wicked tongue of the incompetent Lord Mayor of Brisbane, but they do not report it, which I think is very sad.']\n",
      "[\"In relation to another important federal government program, Work for the Dole, this Lord Mayor of Brisbane's arrogance knows no bounds. Thousands of people in my electorate are currently missing out on the opportunity to be part of the very successful Work for the Dole scheme. Why? Because the Lord Mayor says he does not like it. In the suburb of Moorooka alone, there are 428 people who are recipients of Newstart or youth allowance who are not part of a Work for the Dole scheme because of the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. In Rocklea, there are 104 people; in Salisbury, 183 people; in Coopers Plains, 220 people; in Holland Park and Tarragindi, 601 people; in Mount Gravatt and Upper Mount Gravatt, 1,185 people; in Runcorn and Eight Mile Plains, 705 people; and in Sunnybank and Macgregor, 937 people—all let down by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane and his failure to adopt a cooperative approach to the government's successful Work for the Dole program. As a result of that, worthwhile community projects are not being undertaken. An example is the proposal that was announced on Australia Day by the Liberal candidate for Lord Mayor, Gail Austen—a great worker for the youth of Brisbane and Queensland, a Telstra Businesswoman of the Year recipient in 1997, somebody who understands the real issues of Brisbane and has been prepared to go and talk with the people, consult with them and air their aspirations in her campaign thus far. She announced on Australia Day that a Liberal council in Brisbane city not only would be part of the Work for the Dole scheme but would also introduce a graffiti removal team conceptsomething that is absolutely needed and wanted by Neighbourhood Watch groups throughout my electorate.\"]\n",
      "['The Lord Mayor of Brisbane turns his back on the dignity, the hope and the experience that people could be gaining through Work for the Dole. Meals on Wheels and other community care organisations in my electorate are also missing out on the assistance that could come from those thousands of people who are looking for the opportunity. Toohey Forest and the bushland rehabilitation process that is undertaken by a worthwhile community group are also missing out on assistance. The same thing is true for the Tarragindi Reserve. And where feral weed species are now overgrowing the urban creeks and waterways in my electorate, we could have worthwhile Work for the Dole projects to identify, eradicate, rehabilitate and revitalise those urban creeks and waterways. Rocky Waterholes Creek, which runs through Salisbury and Rocklea is a prime example, as is Stable Swamp Creek, which runs through Sunnybank, Coopers Plains and Rocklea. Other examples are Mimosa Creek, which has its heart in Nathan, near Griffith University, and runs through Macgregor; Norman Creek which runs through Tarragindi, Annerley and Greenslopes; Bulimba Creek, which runs through Sunnybank, Runcorn, Eight Mile Plains and Wishart; and Moolabin Creek, which goes through Moorooka, Yeerongpilly and Tennyson. That is not to mention, of course, Oxley Creek, which is a prime recipient of a lot of those smaller creeks and waterways. ']\n",
      "[\"So worthwhile community projects are not taking place and people in the local community are not being given the hope and experience they should get, all because of the style of decision making and the sheer arrogance of this incompetent Lord Mayor of Brisbane, this man who rings up older ladies and abuses them over the phone. What is extraordinary about all that, though, is the comparison with the Brisbane City Council's conduct in days past when the failed programs of the Keating era were available to them. During the period 1992-96, the Brisbane City Council in fact was contracted to go along and manage 19 Jobskills, Landcare and Environment Action ProgramLEAPand New Work Opportunities programs in Brisbane. At one stage they were the largest broker of these sorts of programs. They were contracted in those days to provide 3,323 job seekers with work experience and training, at a total cost to the Commonwealth of $28,488,095 under those programs. The average cost per placement in those brokered programs from the BCC was $8,573; that was per person. In those days the Brisbane City Council saw no philosophical difficulty with being part of programs that were forerunners of what is now a much more finetuned, focused and effective program such as Work for the Dole. It pains me to see the people of Brisbane, the ratepayers of Brisbane of whom I am one, also missing out on the extra subsidy that could come their way as a result of the federal government giving money to the Brisbane City Council to broker those programs, and the opportunities and activities that could be undertaken to the benefit of the people of Brisbane that I have already outlined in my speech.\"]\n",
      "[\"The people of Brisbane have an opportunity to get rid of this lord mayor, and I am inviting them to do so, and with some gusto. I think that there are a lot of people who are literally waiting there to sneak up on this man and dismiss him from office. He faces the people on 25 March with a statement that he is not going to run again if he is re-elected. On 25 March he is going to be re-elected for a four-year term and he wants a victory lap. He wants to take Brisbane into 13 years of Soorley Labor. We saw what happened here in Canberra when Keating had 13 years. We cannot subject Brisbane to the same sorts of difficulties and debt that came out of the Labor Party in this place. We can talk about debt in quite a deal of detail, because under the Soorley administration debt has gone up greatly. It is way over all expectations and projections, and they just keep spending, and they keep spending on things within the inner city, not on things in the suburbs. Basic services that are expected by my constituents are being missed out on. Moreover, money that comes from this level of government to that level of government to provide services is not being provided. I find it extraordinary, given all those matters that I have just outlined, that each and every time I write to constituents to keep them across my activities as the federal member the Australian Labor Party councillors are forever saying, `You shouldn't write to your constituents, you shouldn't keep them informed.' The last group in the community I am ever going to take advice from, with the greatest of respect, are members of the Australian Labor Party, because they have let down Australians so badly over so many years. I would not have to do all these things if the councillors in my area actually did their job.\"]\n",
      "[\"I would like to turn for a moment to the state government of Queensland. The state government of Queensland are developing a similar arrogant style. They are showing themselves also to be lacking in the ability to properly consult. It is interesting to note that, in the case of the south-east freeway-busway project that is taking place through my electorate at the moment, Mr Mario Furlan and his mother, of Eight Mile Plains, have got to put up with a third attempt to get an off-ramp right for the south-east freeway onto the Logan Road at Eight Mile Plains. Each time the state government embark upon a realignment of the road they crib a bit more of Mrs Furlan's land and crib a bit more off again. Those opposite will run around and say they are the great protectors of the environment, but it is extraordinary that in the first attempt to get the off-ramp right, which comes out onto what is left of Priestdale Road at Eight Mile Plains, they filled in the natural watercourse. They actually put landfill into the creek. As a result, what was a creek and waterway, a tributary of Bulimba Creek, has a 90-degree dogleg in it. I have no doubt, whatever your belief is, that God did not create the earth with a lot of 90 degree doglegs in natural watercourses, for good reasons. But the Queensland Labor government know better than the Almighty on these matters. What is extraordinary is that with the third attempt on this they are now talking about moving that watercourse even further away from what was its natural course— \"]\n",
      "INTERJECTOR: Larry Anthony\n",
      "[\"That is correct, Minister. Yet the opportunity exists, if they care to listen to local residents, to actually reinstall the natural watercourse by digging out the landfill they put in there and putting in a culvert, and not having to take more of Mrs Furlan's property. There have been attempts to write to the Minister for Transport, Steve Bredhauer, who I think is probably one of the worst ministers in the Queensland government, and also for that matter to Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, who flicks it straight to Steve Bredhauer every time. On each occasion the minister has followed the Premier's lead and simply ignored the views of the Furlan family. They are a family who have lived a simple existence on this property. They have suffered a greater deal of tragedy than members in this place would appreciate, with Mr Furlan's father being murdered at a Brisbane City Council bus depot a few years ago for the change that was in his bus driver's change tin. It is extraordinary to me that the Queensland government will not even listen to the Furlans' quite reasonable series of requests on this matter. They have simply said that it would cost $400,000 to do what the Furlans ask, which is to reuse the old watercourse, to put in a culvert on the third attempt to get this off-ramp right. They have been told without any qualification, `It is $400,000; go away.'\"]\n",
      "['I am calling on the Queensland Premier to get decent. It strikes me that it is not good enough just simply to write back and offer a figure, and flick it that way. The $400,000 needs to be quantified in a far more direct way. They need to subtract from it the cost of rebuilding parts of Priestdale Road at Eight Mile Plains. They need to assess the cost of land acquisition and they need to factor it into this $400,000 and justify where they got the $400,000 figure from. I have written to the Premier and asked him to do that. I raise it here because, as I said at the outset of my speech, the money that comes from the matters before us today goes to other levels of government. Therefore the way they spend the money we give to them, the style of the decision making that they undertake and the lack of consultation that they embark upon are all issues which should be raised in this place. I think we all expect some accountability and credibility from other levels of government and it is my role as a federal member, somebody effectively representing the people in my electorate, to demand that we get that accountability and credibility at every juncture.']\n",

I would especially like to thank the voters of Holt who supported me in significant numbers at the by-election on 6 November last year. However, like many of my colleagues here and in other great representative chambers across our nation, I know that this support had everything to do with the fact that the initials `ALP' were alongside my name on the ballot paper. Our party not only is the oldest political party but is the strongest. It is part of our national fabric. Time and time again when the chips are down the Australian people look to the ALP to rebuild, to re-energise and to renew the Australian dream.

The opportunities for Australia to grow and prosper have never been greater than they are today. It may well be that the last century was the American century. The United States emerged from isolationism to assert a strong and, in the main, reasonable leadership role in the world in areas such as regional defence, information technology and the opening up of the international economy. Why can't we here in this region aspire for this century to be the Australian century, 100 years where the great potential, the tremendous promise of Australia, is manifested in achievement, manifested in pursuing all the opportunities of a new economy, manifested in all Australians participating in the information technology renaissance, with access to this information in all Australian living rooms, not just in a select few, manifested in us playing a key collaborative role in the region as defenders of freedom, democratic values and human rights—universal, not just Australian, values?\"]\n",

They did so when they chose to socially progress the nation with Whitlam and when they chose Hawke and Keating to internationalise and progress the country economically.

This cannot be allowed to continue, for if we do nothing in this place and out there in our electorates this community sentiment will corrode the country. Governments who practise the politics of division unwittingly unleash dangerous currents of violence and hate, much of it against innocent victims. They precipitate a dangerous rent in the social fabric of a community which goes against everything we stand for as Australians, particularly with inherent belief in fairness to all within our community. We have all seen the ultimate result of this dark form of politics spewing venom and bile and messages of hatred in this place. It is a dark stain on this country's history when people in my electorate have been afraid to walk the main streets of Dandenong and Springvale South because their names are not Smith, Jones or Hanson. They call this dark form of politics wedge politics; I call it un-Australian. I say it should have no place in this country. \"]\n",

These are policies designed for the inner cities of this country rather than for the rest of it. This is exacerbating this sense of disillusionment further, further increasing these fault lines, particularly in my electorate and, I believe, in the rest of the country. They do not believe that there is a sense of essential Australian fairness in government when it is skewed towards High Street, Armidale rather than Maramba Drive, Narrewarren. They have been disenfranchised and their sense of powerlessness and frustration is not being helped by images of arrogance and lack of concern about economic policy by policy makers and their beneficiaries. A recent example is the media reporting of Westpac traders cheering on TV the latest interest rate rise. This was regarded as insulting by all thinking Australians. What I suspect was just as galling was the banks' mad scramble to jag up their rates as quickly as possible. If only interest rate reductions were passed on so quickly.\"]\n",

How much investment in my region and in the country would be halted and how many jobs would be lost? People are concerned about what they view as a callous disregard by policy makers and governments about the effects of their policies on those who live in the outer suburbs and regions. These are the very same people who have been buffeted by the profound technological changes and job restructuring that have swept through our country and who have been swept away by the tidal wave of globalisation. It is callousness beneath contempt when policy makers turn on those who have been the victims of these changes, which have wiped out jobs and industries, single them out and tell them that it is their fault that they are in the predicament they are in.']\n",

I believe that we have seen weather veins of this discord and that it will be one of the major issues that will have to be addressed by governments in the next five to 10 years. What we do in this place will have a profound bearing on whether we can stem this rising tide of community disillusionment and disenfranchisement.']\n",

Not only were we having a once in a generation referendum on our nationhood, we were also enduring an interregnum period of state government prior to the election of the Bracks Labor government in another by-election campaign in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. This unique concurrence of events created some uncomfortable situations, like the time I doorknocked in Narrewarren. The lady at the door greeted me very enthusiastically. She was fulsome in her support for me and was looking forward to seeing me in the new government. I was incredibly heartened until she asked me how my campaign for the state seat of Frankston East was going. But mostly it provided me with one of the richest experiences of my life. The people of Holt welcomed me to their homes, and they did not complain when I arrived on their doorsteps at all times of day and night. They did not object when I greeted them at shopping centres on weekends. They were welcoming and encouraging when I appeared at train stations when they were going to and coming from work, sometimes at ungodly hours like 5.30 in the morning.

It is fascinating to note that, of the 1996 census ranking of the 20 top electorates which had a high proportion of manufacturing as the basis for employment, 19 were held by the ALP and one was held by the coalition. The one seat that was held by the coalition in 1996, Kingston, subsequently fell to the ALP in 1998 and is now very ably represented by my colleague David Cox.']\n",

Additionally, most people, some 94.7 per cent of the working electorate, are employees, not employers. This again is one of the highest proportions in the country. It is a seat where the median age is about 30 and where approximately 20 per cent of its residents are on some form of social security assistance. A large percentage of the electorate have recently purchased homes.

      "[\"In addition, it is recognised that there may be a few producers who were dairying in 1998-99 and remain in the industry and yet, for one reason or another, do not meet all the criteria for a standard entitlement. In such cases the authority would have some discretion to consider their claim and may allocate an entitlement based on their `anomalous' circumstances.\"]\n",
      "[\"It is the government's intention that all eligible participants in the industry—owner-operators, sharefarmers, lessees and lessors—share these payments. The entitlement determined for each party will reflect their share of the revenue received from milk sales from the enterprise in question as at 28 September 1999. Consideration will also be given to the extent to which each party contributed to the enterprise. For example, where a party contributes elements considered essential to achieving access to the market milk premium, such as quota or, in its absence, land and livestock, they would be eligible to share also in the premium payment associated with the market milk payment.\"]\n",

It is not intended that entitlement holders will be required to remain involved in the farm which generated their entitlement and they can exit and continue to receive their payment stream or dispose of it to another primary producer. Equally, sharefarmers would be in a position to invest in their own enterprise if they so chose. ']\n",

The details of the imposition of the levy are contained in the accompanying levy imposition bills. Sales of imported milk will also be covered by the levy, as the levy will apply to all liquid milk products sold domestically at the point of use. Liquid milk products destined to be exported will be exempt. ']\n",

The levy will cease when all payments are made and costs are met. ']\n",

      "[\"The 11c per litre levy is not expected, of itself, to lead to increased retail milk prices, with deregulation. While there will be variability between regions, depending on market factors, the farm gate price for market milk is expected to fall towards the manufacturing milk price, with margins expected to reflect distance, environmental and seasonal factors and the ability of producers to negotiate supply contracts with manufacturers. The industry's estimate is that the deregulated price will fall by up to 15c per litre. The levy is less than this anticipated fall in price to farmers. The ACCC will monitor retail milk prices before and for six months after introduction of the levy to ensure any price changes are in accordance with acceptable competitive practices.\"]\n",

The main role of the authority will be to assess applications for payments in accordance with statutory eligibility criteria and to direct the ADC in delivering payments. Decisions of the authority will be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The management of the package will, of course, be subject to the normal Commonwealth accountability, audit and reporting requirements of statutory bodies.']\n",
      "['The board of the authority will comprise five persons. There will be two dairy industry members, another two members who have specific qualifications in the fields of business management, finance, legal or actuarial practice—one of whom will be the chair—and a government member. Once the initial assessment of applications has been finalised and the payment arrangements are well established—I presume after about two years—I anticipate the authority will be phased down to a smaller body.']\n",
      "['Producers will be given a strict three-month period in which to register their interest in an entitlement. Initially, the authority will endeavour to contact all producers whose names are on delivery records of companies, cooperatives or state milk authorities. During this period, the authority will undertake an extensive public advertising campaign to ensure that there is widespread awareness of the package and to alert anyone who may have an interest in a payment about how they should go about establishing eligibility. Importantly, any application for an entitlement needs to be lodged in this period, as it will not subsequently be possible to adjust entitlements after they have been allocated by the authority.']\n",
      "['This package assists producers of all scales of operation to adjust their enterprises to the new market realities. The government is committed to ensuring dairy farmers have the choices and the support either to continue in the industry profitably or to exit agriculture with dignity.

Consumers will ultimately benefit from the deregulated market.']\n",

That rejection was undeniably a very real blow to the industry which in recent years has been the victim of a series of events well beyond its control or influence. As coordinator of the federal National Party sugar industry task force, I was supportive then of that submission and I remain supportive now. Despite the rejection last December, I am sufficiently hopeful that the government will further consider the matter in light of subsequent important developments. Those developments include a very successful visit to my electorate last month by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Andersonsomething I will speak on later.']\n",
      "['By way of background, it is useful that I provide a brief overview of the state of the sugar industry at this point in time. The latest informed predictions for the future of the industry are contained in the 1999 December quarter publication of Australian Commodities. World sugar prices are forecast to average US6.4c a pound in 1999-2000. That is a considerable drop from the 1997-98 price of around US12.6c a pound. As Australian Commodities noted:']\n",

      "[\"The prediction is that, in the face of current uncertainties about future development, there is a 75 per cent probability that the price this financial year will be in the range of US5.7c to US7c a pound. Today's figure is US5.43c a pound, significantly below the predicted minimum.\"]\n",
      "[\"Australian Commodities also predicted that world sugar production will rise this financial year, to an estimated 132 million tonnes, and that there would be only a modest demand for increased imports. The economic recovery in Asia is expected to produce increased consumption but also increased production, with importing countries such as Indonesia, India and the Philippines limiting the scope for a major increase in Australia's sugar exports to those countries.\"]\n",
      "['The 1999 crushing season in Queensland has now ended and the yields of sugar and the price for cane have been determined. According to Queensland Canegrowers, sugar levels are well below long-term trends and so are yields, with losses of up to 25 per cent between 1997 and 1999. Queensland Canegrowers has also pointed to the results of the devastating fall in the world sugar price and has estimated that income per hectare has fallen by an unbelievable 41 per cent across North Queensland, with the income effect in some districts representing a loss of up to 47 per cent.']\n",
      "[\"As recently as Monday, the General Manager of Queensland Canegrowers, Mr Ian Ballantyne, warned that recent flooding rains in North Queensland had damaged some 25 per cent of the estimated 10 million tonnes of cane between Ingham and Cairns, an area that produces about a quarter of Queensland's annual crop. With the current world price of sugar hovering at around US5.5c a pound, a figure well below the cost of production by even the most efficient and fortunate cane farmer, the industry is demonstrably in need of urgent and sympathetic consideration by both state and federal governments.\"]\n",
      "['I began my comments today by mentioning that Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson had made a very welcome and most successful trip to my electorate last month. During that visit, Mr Anderson met with cane growers and was made fully aware of their difficulties. I believe it is no exaggeration to say that he came away from those meetings much better informed. I am also pleased to say that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, is visiting my electorate this Friday, again to meet with cane growers, and I have no doubt that he also will come away well informed and with a far better understanding of the difficulties that we face. ']\n",
      "['Can I say with gratitude that it is remembered that Mr Anderson, while he was Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, approved $13.45 million across four years for vital industry research, which looked at studies on low ccs and also at work against pests such as the grey backed cane grub. Certainly farmers, while disappointed that their request for a declaration of exceptional circumstances was rejected last December, are even more resolved to have the matter reconsidered. In that campaign they have my unconditional support, and I do ask that the government agree to a re-examination. The current criteria for the declaration of exceptional circumstances plainly cannot address the plight of many deserving primary producers and needs to be reworked. Frankly, if primary producers can go through three major floods and a cyclone and have a quarter of their produce ruined and still not be eligible, it begs the question: what sort of calamity is required and how desperate do honest, hardworking farmers have to be to receive a safety net?']\n",
      "['I know that the minister for agriculture, the Hon. Warren Truss, is certainly sympathetic to the sugar industry and the often harsh realities of life faced by farmers. I am confident that he will give our request consideration and trust that he will rethink the matter of exceptional circumstances and the criteria that apply. In a recent letter to Mr Truss, Queensland Canegrowers formally requested a review of the rejection of their request for a declaration of exceptional circumstances, and they made some very valid points, which I would like draw upon now. The General Manager, Mr Ballantyne, wrote:']\n",
      "['Despite the intimate knowledge that this organisation has of the circumstances of the 1998 and 1999 seasons, we have had no formal contact with the exceptional circumstances process since our initial submission to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI). We have not been privy to the QDPI submission, nor the detail of any further communication between State and Federal agencies. ']\n",
      "['Mr Ballantyne continued:']\n",
      "[\"Canegrowers has been frustrated by its inability to have further input into the process of determining whether the requirements for the declaration of Exceptional Circumstances have been met. We have not have had the ability to have further input after our initial submission and have not discussed the detail and the shortcomings of our submission with the decision-makers. No member of your department or of the RASAC board visited either the Canegrowers office or the affected area. The reasons for `failure to meet guidelines' have never been elaborated on.\"]\n",
      "['These are certainly valid points of concern. My appeal to Minister Truss and to the government is not just to revisit the previously rejected application for exceptional circumstances from Queensland Canegrowers but to give serious consideration to a thorough review of the existing process. It seems to me that this process is in need of an overhaul when, in this case, it took eight months for Queensland Canegrowers to learn of the outcome of their application and then to learn about it via a media statement. I believe both the state and federal governments need to consult to ensure that the process is relevant, transparent and sympathetic and, above all, to ensure that there is regular contact between those making an application and those considering it.']\n",
      "['I would like to move now to the visit to my electorate by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson. One matter that was a raised with him by local cane growers was the possible development of the Elliot Main Channel. This potential project underlines most importantly the long-term confidence that cane growers and others have in the industry in North Queensland. Canegrowers Burdekin Chairman, Mr George Nielsen, and the Bowen Collinsville Enterprise Chairman, Mr David Evans, made a considerable impression on Mr Anderson, and I want to compliment them for their persuasive and thorough submission to him on the Elliot Channel and other matters.']\n",
      "['If construction of the Elliot Main Channel does ultimately proceed, it would open up another 15,000 hectares of land between Home Hill and Bowen for cane growing and would be worth $70 million a year, at current prices. Cane growers have made the point, and I agree with them, that any such project must be carried out only in conjunction with an increase in capacity of the entire irrigation system to ensure that the water entitlements of existing Burdekin irrigators are not jeopardised. Of course, the cost of water from any new project must also be considered as it would be well nigh impossible for cane growers to expand if prices were significantly higher than those currently charged. ']\n",
      "[\"These questions remain for the future. However, I mentioned the Elliot Channel for two very important reasons: it underlines most emphatically the fact that cane growers and farmers generally are steadfastly confident in their industry's long-term future, and it again illustrates the fundamental and realistic commitment that the Deputy Prime Minister and the National Party have to the sugar industry. \"]\n",
      "['I will move to one other matter. I have had quite a lot of response from my electorate to the recent frenzy that the Labor Party has created over the desperately needed assistance to the workers hit by the collapse of National Textiles. The campaign run by the Labor Party is as hypocritical and heartless as it is cold-bloodedly cynical. Initially when that company collapsed, there was a great chorus of demand from the Labor Party for the government to take urgent action to extend aid to the displaced workers. Of course, Labor had to demand this, having been a government that for 13 years of inglorious rule did not lift a finger to put in place a safety net system. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith, has pointed out that during those 13 long years Labor did not even commit to a national scheme to protect worker entitlements in its eight separately negotiated accords with the ACTU.']\n",
      "[\"The opposition leader, Mr Beazley, who led that charge, was a minister for all of those 13 years. He was Minister for Employment, Education and Training for two years from December 1991 to December 1993. He had two tries at being Minister for Finance, and he ended up being Deputy Prime Minister. While he was minister for employment—and presumably concerned about workers' rights and entitlements—Mr Beazley was a key player in the negotiation of the Accord Mark VII. It contained the very first small mention—little more than a footnote—of worker entitlements on insolvency. It was not surprising, though, because that was four days before the election. At that time, the Labor government was prepared to say or to do anything to cling to power—I am sure we all remember the notorious l-a-w tax cuts—yet little interest was shown in providing a national safety net for workers.\"]\n",
      "['The 1993 Accord provided for a modest change in priorities to allow employees to receive payment before the Commissioner of Taxation but after secured creditors. The 1995 Accord only promised that a Labor government would:']\n",

      "['Minister Reith, in his statement of 8 February, noted:']\n",
      "[\"The ACTU's own figures estimate that 17,000 workers each year are not paid entitlements on insolvency, and that the average amount of money owed to workers who are left with unpaid entitlements on insolvency is $7,000 per person. If this is right (and data is not readily available on this issue), during Labor's 13 years 221,000 workers were left unprotected by Labor, losing some $1.25 billion in unpaid entitlements. Yet virtually nothing was done.\"]\n",
      "['Given this shameful and disgraceful record, I can only wonder why the Labor Party and its leader have the gall to wage a campaign against the Prime Minister and the government for helping the employees of National Textiles. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition and state and federal Labor MPs from the Hunter Valley, where the company operated, begged, implored and demanded that action be taken by the government to help the workers—help, incidentally, that not one sacked worker received from the Labor Party when it was in office from 1983 to 1996.']\n",
      "[\"It cannot be claimed that the Leader of the Opposition did not know about the plight of the unemployed when he was minister for employment. After all, the national unemployment rate soared to 12 per cent. Do you know why the Labor Party have raised this matter? It is simply because the Prime Minister's brother happens to be the chairman of National Textiles. That is why they have taken this up. Mr Beazley demanded that the government do something that he either refused to do or neglected to do while in government, and when the Prime Minister responded to the appeal from the workers in a practical and positive way, there was a hue and cry about some trumped up conflict of interest for the Prime Minister. The Labor Party should stop their posturing and answer one simple question: should the workers who were employed by National Textiles be given assistance as demanded by the Labor Party or should those workers get no assistance? \"]\n",
      "['The Prime Minister assisted those workers for one reason only—they made an appeal to him. In a compassionate way, having met the families, he addressed their concerns—and for no other reason. Knowing the Prime Minister and how honest he is, I think he would have wrestled long and hard with the fact that a family member was, in a very indirect way, involved with the company. But concern for those workers and their families quite rightly overrode other considerations.']\n",
      "[\"The Employee Entitlements Support Scheme, which has been outlined by Minister Reith, is a landmark scheme which for the very first time gives workers who have been dismissed since 1 January 2000 because of their employers' insolvency, administration or bankruptcy up to $20,000 to make up for unpaid entitlements. As Minister Reith has so rightly stated, this scheme is the most comprehensive extension of the social security safety net since the introduction of superannuation. It took a coalition government to do it—something that no worker, employed or otherwise, should ever forget. \"]\n",
      "['Regrettably of course there has to be some cut-off point. All of us would wish that everything could be made retrospective, but the reality is that no scheme—no legislation—can be made retrospective forever. There has to be a cut-off point, harsh as that may be sometimes. We cannot reach back into history forever, no matter how sympathetic one might be. Obviously the Labor Party did not care about the tens upon tens of thousands of workers who lost their jobs between 1983 and 1996 because their employers went bust, so it is rather late in the day for them to accuse the government of not considering other employees in failed enterprises.']\n",
      "['Having spoken to many people in my electorate and having heard their concerns, all decent Australians are appalled by the attempts to smear and besmirch the character and integrity of the Prime Minister over a compassionate decision to help workers and their families at National Textiles. The Prime Minister has done the right thing. I am proud to be part of a government that listens to those who are often left with no options and no assistance. I believe that the landmark legislation that is to be introduced by Minister Reith will be something that this coalition government will be very proud of long into the future.']\n",
      "#######\n",
      "[\"This is the first week of parliament this year. It is an auspicious week because it marks a dramatic recognition of the failings of this government and its budgetary processes. In the appropriation bills that we have before us, we are talking about a budget of many billions of dollars, but I want to talk about just a few thousands of dollars for individuals. The issue that the previous speaker has been speaking about with regard to National Textiles and the displacement of workers has never been more relevant. In Newcastle in recent times we have seen the displacement of over 3,000 workers at the BHP site. I do not think that most Australians are actually aware that, when someone gets retrenched these days, under this government's policies they cannot access income support. If they cannot access income support they cannot access job seeking support. There are many people now in the electorate of Newcastle and the environs of the Hunter who were working at BHP who are still serving out their entitlements—in other words, their long service leave, their retrenchment leave, their holiday leave. Most of their cache has to be expended before they can access social security, but if their spouse works they cannot access it anyhow. If they cannot access social security, they cannot access job placement support. In other words, they can go along to Drake, Employment National or anybody else but they will not get support with getting a job unless they are on social security. The marginalising in this way by this government of hundreds of thousands of Australians who are desperately seeking work and need work is outrageous. \"]\n",
      "['But the more interesting story in the next few weeks is going to be how Centrelink recovers the money from National Textiles workers who have been paid social security in the short term because they had no money at all. As we know, Centrelink can give money to people who are destitute. But when those employees get their entitlements, guess what the first bill will be—to pay back the money that they got from Centrelink, because they are not entitled to it until they serve out all their entitlements and, in some cases, that may be five or six months. So what the government gives with one hand it takes with the other. I do not think most Australians would agree with that—would think that it was reasonable or fair—and I certainly do not think that most Australians are even aware that it is happening. ']\n",
      "['The other part of this exercise is the use of the Regional Assistance Program. We saw the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business on the Sunday program this week talking about the Regional Assistance Program. He said:']\n",
      "[\"I don't mind saying we have lifted the priority we are giving to regional disadvantage as it were and programs to meet with it and the fact that the textile industry has particular problems. Now a case by case examination by this government through the regional assistance program is not new.\"]\n",
      "[\"A case by case examination through the Regional Assistance Program is not new? Actually, it is true. The Regional Assistance Program has quite rigid and quite detailed requirements as to how you can access it and the kinds of programs and sponsorship. There are pages and pages of details on how it has to be processed through the area consultative committee and also on sponsorship. There must be other money involved; it cannot be only Commonwealth money. There are also quarterly announcements. There are reams of pages. But, in this case, we have seen the government access this program overnight for $2 million. There was no process, no sponsorship, no proven record—nothing. It was just announced. And the minister blithely says, `This is just part of our topping-up program for the Regional Assistance Program.' \"]\n",
      "[\"There were two kinds of workers at the BHP site in Newcastle. There were those employed by the company on the site, and BHP spent a lot of money helping those people with training programs, job placement programs, counselling, financial counselling—a whole of range of things. It was the best we had ever seen. They did those things because the government offered nothing. In previous times that was seen as a public responsibility, but BHP took it on its own shoulders, and I praise them for doing that. But there were about 800 people who worked on the site who were employed by subcontractors who were not part of that exercise. When they were retrenched by their employers they did not get the support that BHP workers got. Minister Abbott was asked by journalists from the Newcastle Herald what was going to happen to the 800 workers who were employed by subcontractors at the BHP site. Mr Abbott said that the government was planning a scheme modelled on BHP's Pathways program. In other words, the government would do for these people what BHP had done for the bulk of the employees—the 2½ thousand from BHP itself. He said that he had met six members of the Prime Minister's task force and that he would offer some assistance for those people through the Regional Assistance Program. \"]\n",
      "['This went on for quite some weeks. Eventually, on 9 October, it was reported that there would be federal money to help the region. The minister announced, in conjunction with the area consultative committee, a $229,000 funding program—$229,000 for 800 people. But, mind you, the funding program dealt with things like multimedia, emerging industries and a joint approach to employment agencies. In other words, more than half the funds were for specialist programs and for organisational issues. There was $100,000 to help struggling BHP subcontractors. But it was not for the workers, it was for the employers—the subcontracting companies—to help them with their businesses. The employees got not one cent. So here we have it: 800 people lose their jobs through a company retrenchment program. They are excluded in the main from all income support until they work out their entitlements. They are excluded from any training programs at all. They are excluded from job placement support. The government promises that it will do something to help, and what did it end up doing? The government gave $100,000 to the employers to help them reposition their businesses.  ']\n",
      "[\"That was just a few months ago, and this is out of the same program, the Regional Assistance Program, that we have now seen used by the minister and the Prime Minister as a political slush fund. What has happened here is outrageous. This whole program is worth $40 million across the country and yet we have seen $2 million used for 300 employees. The government has not explained how the employees will be able to be trained when they cannot access job placements—they are excluded because they have to work out their entitlements—so we have this total contradiction of people who cannot get support for job placements being given the equivalent of $6½ thousand each to be trained. What on earth is the government doing? If it is important to have skilled training for retrenched employees, why isn't that available to all people? Why isn't that part of the normal system? If it is reasonable to take entitlements away from people, as well as their access to income support because they have to work out their long service leave, why isn't it reasonable to give them training? What logic, humanity and consistency is there in all of this? This demonstrates more than anything else that the government's decisions on National Textiles were not motivated by concern for the employees or for good policy. This Regional Assistance Program was used as a political slush fund to try to save grace, and then we have the minister talking a week later about how this was normal! Minister, go back and read your criteria and read about your processes to access this program.\"]\n",
      "[\"In this financial year the budget allocation was $40 million. Up to date $8 million had been spent across the country and then the government spent $2 million on one single company for 300 people. I am pleased for those people. It is good for National Textiles' employees that they actually get some help, but the point I am trying to make is that when BHP closed over 3,000 people were retrenched and the government gave BHP not one bit of help, not one cent in direct help for those employees. Three miles up the road, 300 people get retrenched and there is $2 million for training. How do you equate that? What sense of fairness and balance is in that? What policy parameters drove that decision? They cannot exist in any logical context in the same program. Where was the area consultative committee? One did not see its members involved at all in the announcements, yet the minister's criteria said that the area consultative committee had to manage it and had to be involved.\"]\n",
      "[\"I come back to Mr Abbott's comments in August and later in October. In August the federal minister made the announcement in Newcastle that he was going to be doing things, but he actually conceded that BHP workers deserved a better deal because they would have to exhaust almost all of their severance pay before being eligible for job seeking assistance or unemployment benefits. This government's budget surplus is based on cuts that were made in the budget and in policies back in 1996 and 1997. One of the things that is least understood and yet is the most damaging is the change that excluded people from income support when they were retrenched from their employment. I have had the experience of dealing with dozens of people who have been affected by that. In Newcastle in recent times we have had literally thousands of people affected by it. The way the Job Network changes work means that the budget surplus that has come about as a result of those changes and is being spent by this government is actually the surplus owed to those people. I am pleased that some people from National Textiles got some of that money back, but the fact is that there are literally tens of thousands of people across the country missing out.\"]\n",
      "[\"In the same context, we have the marginalising of those people who have been retrenched and cannot access income support or job placement support. It was anticipated that with Employment National we would at least have a national network of last resort. But what has happened in recent weeks with Employment National does not bear thinking about: the level of incompetent ministerial intrusion and the sheer waste of public funds are just enormous. The government's announcement of the reduction of Employment National from 1,700 people to 650 across the country has substantial consequences for both job seekers and employees. Members would be aware that most of the Employment National staff came from federal departments after the closure of CES, so many of them were ex-CES officers who put their future into Employment National as a vote of confidence in this government's Job Network. They transferred across but right now these people are being conscripted. There are redundancy packages being made available not by interview and evaluation but by direction. People who would rather stay are being forced to leave. \"]\n",
      "[\"In other words, there is no balance in what is occurring. There is no process either, and the systems that are used by the federal department as a normal matter of standard policy have been junked. The government owns a company that operates under rules that the government does support. So the government is demonstrating to the people of Australia that, given its way, this is how it would like to be acting. So you have people being told, `You stay in that job or else just resign; of course, if you resign you will lose all your entitlements,' and the people who want to stay are being told, `No, you're going,' with no assessment, no evaluation and no interview—sheer conscription. This is the way the government wants to run employment. This is its message to the employers of this country: ignore fairness, loyalty and any sense of mutual obligation between employer and employee; just tell people what they are going to do or not do—full stop, with no engagement. So the people who have transferred from CES across to Employment National in good faith, assuming that their entitlements would actually carry on because they had transferred from a government department to a government owned agency, have now been left absolutely bereft.\"]\n",
      "[\"The disloyalty shown by the government in this way has been astounding, but it is no different from what they have shown to the normal people of Australia or to other people who have been retrenched. The message to government department employees now is, `Watch out!' Employment National required people to accept enterprise bargaining and separate contracts, so they have no comeback. Their duties can change overnight by direction; their jobs can change overnight by direction. There is no consultation and there is no process.\"]\n",

Governments that manage businesses of that nature in that way, we all know, are bound to have difficulties. That is not the way to generate a satisfactory organisation. It is not the way to generate employee involvement in businesses and companies. Any decent employer, personnel officer or industrial relations officer would know that. So the government is endorsing in Employment National a method of management which is bound to fail. We will see in the years ahead that Employment National will become a drain on the public purse. It will be demonised and blackguarded. It will be harassed around the countryside, not because of what it is doing but because of what it is being made to do. In other words, the ministers who are driving this are driving it into the ground.']\n",

There is no management logic that would make people stay who want to go or make people go who want to stay. There is no logic to that. You would normally try to find a fit or at least have some justification in a situation where people's information is indispensable. There would be a reason. You should say, `We need you because no-one else knows what you know.' There is none of that. There is no interview. There is no process. There is no evaluation. Employment National is not saying, `We need these core experiences.' They are just being told, `Stay or go.' \"]\n",

Put that together with the first part of what I was saying earlier about the employees—the contradiction in giving National Textiles employees access to training programs but not to job placement programs. They will get some support for job training or skills training or something—God knows what, because we are not being told what it is—at $6,000 per employee. But, notionally, they will not be able to access job placements. Clearly, what the government is doing should involve job placement as well.']\n",

That is the logical thing to do. But they are not doing with National Textiles what would normally have happened under previous governments, including conservative governments. We were not the first government to introduce those kinds of programs; they were there long before us. Governments historically have said that the most important time for an employee who has been retrenched is immediately after the retrenchment, when they are most fresh in terms of their work experience and their self-esteem. This government has said, `No, it is not. It is when they work out their entitlements.'\"]\n",

Those two things in both contexts demonstrate contradiction, inconsistency and lack of logic. When you look at that, you say, `Where is the policy that drives it? Where is the consistency? Where is the vision of this government for the future of this country?' And the answer is that there are not any. It is all about political opportunism.\"]\n",

Advances in modern science and technology have led to the development of drugs which have saved lives, cured diseases, improved the quality of life and increased people's lifespan. On the other hand, unsanctioned use of drugs and use of illicit drugs have caused heartbreak and misery for individuals and their families. Drugs do not discriminate. It is a problem that has the potential to hurt all communities, making no distinction between geographical location, socioeconomic background, culture or language, as we can only too easily see by the examples in our own country and those from around the world.

This allocation is being used to enhance school drug education programs and the management of drug related issues and incidents in schools. Approximately $18 million has been allocated over four years to 2002-03 for the Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs to develop and implement a National School Drug Education Strategy under the education component of the National Illicit Drug Strategy.

The key message of the National School Drug Education Strategy is that there is no place for illicit drugs in schools and that there is support for school students who want to stop taking drugs. This is about being tough on drugs but caring for kids, their families and the broader school community. This goal is based on the belief that illicit and other unsanctioned drug use in schools is unacceptable. Specifically aimed at the needs of school communities, the National School Drug Education Strategy was prepared by the National Advisory Committee on School Drug Education after extensive consultation with education, health and law enforcement professionals, parent groups, community groups and young people themselves. When armed with the facts and supported to resist pressures and the short-term temptations of drug use, the majority of young people are capable of making healthy lifestyle choices, resulting in benefits for themselves and the nation as a whole.

From school and further education to securing employment, the emphasis of modern life is on performance, keeping up with the dramatic pace of change and taking on more and more responsibility from an earlier age. These additional pressures, with the increased potency and availability of illicit substances, make some of our young people increasingly vulnerable to drugs. Young people's belief that they are indestructible can also lead to dangerous experimentation. However, it must be remembered that the majority of young people already say no to drugs or give up experimenting and using drugs without direct or community help. I would like to emphasise that illicit and other unsanctioned drug use is not a major problem in most schools or for most students. However, it has the potential for disruption to families, academic performance, physical development and social integration of young people into the world of adult life.\"]\n",

A higher proportion, in fact 38 per cent of young people aged 14 to 24, used marijuana more than any other illicit drug. What most people do not realise is that today's marijuana varieties can be up to 30 per cent stronger and have very different and more dangerous health consequences. According to a report by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, cannabis in high doses can produce psychotic symptoms, and there is stronger evidence that it worsens schizophrenic illnesses in those who use it daily. Young people need credible information about the health risks of cannabis use. It is important to provide this information in a way that is acceptable to parents yet is not seen by young people as exaggerating the risks. \"]\n",
      "[\"Use of illicit drugs ranges from abstinence through to exposure, experimentation, occasional use, problematic use and also addiction. Drug use may be associated with other problems in a young person's life and with a range of other problematic behaviours. Parents, teachers and the wider community should be made aware that drug use by some adolescents can be related to an emerging personality disorder or mental illness requiring referral for a thorough medical examination and assessment. The recent report `Australia's Young People: Their Health and Wellbeing' showed that over 20 per cent of young people, 23 per cent of males and 18 per cent of females, aged 12 to 16 years of age were found to have some mental health problem. It is an even greater problem amongst young adults, with 27 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds having a mental disorder. During a 12-month period ending in 1997, just over one in five males and one in 10 females aged 18 to 24 were found to have a substance use disorder. For both sexes, alcohol related disorders were most common. These are very disturbing statistics.\"]\n",

      "[\"This appropriation bill deals with a range of appropriations and the first one I want to talk about concerns that for the Australian Taxation Office. The appropriation calls for $118 million to be appropriated for various costs relating to the implementation of the goods and services tax and related changes to the tax system. The major items are $60 million per year to cover increased administration costs arising from the partial removal of food from the GST base and $43.72 million to implement changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. To put that into lay terms, this appropriation is part of the pay-off for the GST. One is there as a result of the Democrats and the other is there as a result of the National Party. Indeed, the public gets to pay for a tax system that 60 per cent of the public do not want. Imagine how successful the Democrats would have been had they announced prior to the federal election, `We are the party for a half-baked GST. Vote for us on that basis.' I doubt that they would have been very successful on that basis. The Australian people were indeed conned and, although they are gleeful now, the Democrats will feel the brunt of that soon enough. \"]\n",
      "['This particular appropriation also indicates the cost that the community will bear in many other ways for that quick and shabby deal. First I want to compare the implementation costs for the GST. If you look at the implementation costs on the side of business, particularly small business, they are a substantial nasty.

      "[\"In exchange for becoming a tax collector for the government, small businesses get to receive the princely sum of $200 by way of voucher. By way of comparison, in order to implement another stage of the GST and take on these additional functions, the tax office is set here to get an extra $118 million. As part of the implementation of the GST, the tax office is getting its resources beefed up. We are told that more officers are going to be employed and this bill is another part of that. But we need to look at what the end result of this is going to be: what it is going to do to the tax office, how it will affect the tax office's normal functions and how it will affect the average taxpayer. \"]\n",
      "['If you look at the information provided by the government, the ATO should have recruited some 2,200 staff by now to help it with the implementation of the GST. The end aim is said to be a total of 4,000 additional staff, with the ATO saying that about 600 will come from the wholesale sales tax area, leaving a net increase of 3,400 over time. The Portfolio Budget Statement for the Taxation Office listed an increase in the number of staff from 1998-99 to 1999-2000 of 2,072 staff. That is a lot of staff to be hired in a short time. I dare say there is some competition in the marketplace for staff with expertise in the area of the goods and services tax. This does point to a poaching problem. You have the ATO hiring staff and training staff who are subsequently being picked up by the private sector, having been trained up by the public sector. That is something I intend to keep an eye on. ']\n",
      "[\"Let us look at what has actually happened with ATO staff numbers. From the Public Service Gazette, we see that, from 7 October last year until 3 February, 1,189 staff have actually been recruited, considerably fewer than the government has said the tax office needs. And where have these staff come from? According to the Gazette, the split has been 702 from internal transfers and promotions and 487 from external recruitment. So the tax office has been getting 60 per cent of its GST staff from internal sources. That means that the other business lines are losing out and being neglected as a result of the tax office's new focus on the GST, and tax office staff are being sucked into an ever-growing GST vortex. For example, 400 staff have been taken from the individual non-business tax line. That accounts for over 10 per cent of the staff in this area. This is a matter of some concern to all PAYE taxpayers, because these are the people who check off our tax returns and who deal with any issues, problems or queries that members of the public may have. So you find the GST area being beefed up at the expense of the average PAYE taxpayer.\"]\n",
      "[\"I would certainly hope that the substantial drop in staff numbers of the individual non-business tax line does not lead to a drop in the processing time of taxpayers' returns. Once again, that is something that I intend to keep a close eye on. Looking at the small business area of the tax office, 600 staff have come from there in order to deal with the GST. That is a matter of some concern for thousands of small business owners, who will now find it more difficult to get non-GST based advice out of the tax office. These positions are not being backfilled so, as a result, both the individual non-business line and the small business line have vastly fewer staff members than they had previously. This is robbing Peter to pay Paulalthough, in this case, I dare say it is Paul who is doing the robbing.\"]\n",
      "['On 28 June last year the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, raised a question concerning this topic and was told by the Treasurer that the notion that efficiencies to be achieved elsewhere in the tax office are to fund the GST is completely wrong. If that is the case, why has the individual non-business line of the tax office seen 400 staff go directly to the GST area? Why is it that the small business line has seen 600 staff transferred directly to the GST area? This is a direct transfer from other areas of the tax office to the GST area.']\n",
      "[\"Yesterday I had an answer from the Treasurer to a question on notice. One aspect of my question concerned the number of staff in the tax office in the various states over the last number of years. For example, tax office staff in Victoria have gone down from over 4,100 to 3,100 in the space of two years, that is, a drop of 1,000 tax officers, or 25 per cent. In New South Wales, the drop is even more substantial: from 4,800 to 3,300, a drop of over 1,500 staff—down 31 per cent. Similarly, in Queensland some 680 staff, or 26 per cent of that state's tax office officers, have been lost. In South Australia, there has been a drop of over 30 per cent and, in Tasmania, a drop of 12 per cent. There is one place where the tax office staff have increased. That is the ACT, where 1,300 staff have been added to tax office numbers—a dramatic increase of 45 per cent.\"]\n",
      "[\"I have recently commented on the lack of staff in Western Australia as well as the closure of tax office cashier functions in Western Australia and the loss of the ATO's face-to-face drop-in inquiry service. The figures the government has provided to me underscore a dramatic shift in the tax office away from providing services and checking returns towards centralised GST policy making in Canberra. The goods and services tax is consuming the tax office's energies to the detriment of both its regional presence and its other responsibilities. Right now within the tax office there is a dramatic shift away from providing services and checking returns towards GST policy making in the ACT.\"]\n",
      "[\"That process of sucking tax office staff into the GST vortex has gathered even more momentum since the time the Treasurer's figures date from—31 August 1999. But, since November, we have seen 1,900 staff being recruited by the tax office for GST work. Of those, 1,000 were internal recruits from the small business and individual non-business areas of Tax, whose positions have not been backfilled. So tax office energies have been directed towards GST to the detriment of that regional presence and the other responsibilities which we all expect of the tax office. \"]\n",
      "[\"Meanwhile, out in the real world, small business is having a terrible time of it, as well as community organisations and charities. In the time remaining, I want to deal with some of those problems. First, businesses cannot get a straight answer out of the government concerning the display of pre- and post-GST price tags. At this time last year—February—responding to the concern that I and others had expressed that the ACCC had only 40 staff to monitor the prices of 1.4 million businesses and that that would allow them just three minutes and 20 seconds of scrutiny per business in the first 12 months of operation, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation said, `No, that does not matter, because there are over 13 million price surveillance officers—the consumers of Australia—who will be monitoring prices each and every day.' If you want to monitor prices, it might help if you could actually see what the cost of the GST is on your price tag, or at least get some indication of prices before and after the implementation of the GST. Notwithstanding that, we found the Treasurer trying to ban the display of before and after GST price tags, publicly stating that the GST must be embedded in the price, which is of course a code word for `hidden' in the price.\"]\n",
      "['That position was utterly indefensible. Over and again the Liberal Party argues against government interference in retailing and professes its belief in the power of the well-informed consumer. Yet here we had the Treasurer saying that retailers who have made it clear that they wanted to show before and after price tags should not be allowed to do so and that consumers should not be given as much information as is available. Quite reasonably, retailers revolted as a result of this and they raised serious practical issues that would impact on the day-to-day conduct of their business. The government went into a huddle and we had the spectacle last week of Senator Kemp, before the Senate estimates, being unable to tell the senators what was going to happen with pre- and post-GST price tags. He said that was a matter being looked at by the ACCC. He was reported in the Financial Review as being unable to reveal whether the government supported dual pricing either as a measure to inform consumers or to give stores more time to change price tags. The Financial Review quite correctly reported that government policy in this area had been thrown into confusion.']\n",
      "[\"Then the government came out of the huddle saying, `We are going to display these price tags for a short time only and, instead of banning it, we are going to make it mandatory.' This was a complete backflip but, once again, just like their previous position, it posed great practical problems for retailers and was in absolute contempt of the Liberal Party's oft professed philosophical commitment to minimising government interference in the marketplaces. What the government should have done was to adopt Labor's position on this where GST would have been publicly identified so consumers could see its impact. But, given the situation the government have got themselves into, we clearly need to make this as workable as we possibly can for retailers and small business. So far the government are doing anything but.\"]\n",
      "['There are a range of other compliance issues which small business has had to deal with in trying to come to terms with the GST. There were revelations that the Taxation Office was looking at charging fees for giving advice and GST rulings. After that was publicly revealed by the Herald Sun the government quashed it. People were given advice that they could not even get the $200 GST vouchers if they belonged to an industry association which had received assistance from the GST Start-Up Assistance Office. That advice turned out to be wrong. It makes it very difficult for small businesses and their advisers to work in those circumstances. Interestingly, the government was unwilling to reveal exactly how industry associations have spent the money that they have received from the GST Start-Up Assistance Office. They have received a $130 million allocation and we are told that details of the subcontracts from these industry associations will not be tracked. Peak bodies that have received funding are calling for dozens of tenders, primarily from accounting firms. Mr Hagan, on behalf of the start-up office, said: ']\n",
      "[\"I haven't collected that information, we've not sought to micro-manage the process ...\"]\n",
      "[\"I think there are some pretty serious issues of accountability here. If a Labor government proposed some massive change to superannuation, for example, and we said, `We're going to give $130 million to the ACTU and we're not going to micro-manage the process and find out just where this money is going,' people would express all sorts of concerns about accountability. These issues are significant and the public has a right to know just how this money is being spent.\"]\n",
      "['I also mention that the GST is a nightmare for clubs. Late last year an organisation known as Clubs Victoria, which represents many licensed clubs such as RSLs and bowling clubs, requested and received permission from the ACCC to advise its member clubs that they could add 10 per cent to the cost of post July membership subscriptions to account for the GST. Acting on this advice, Clubs Victoria issued a circular to all its members concerning the application of GST to post 1 July subscriptions. The ACCC then wrote to Clubs Victoria on 16 December saying:']\n",
      "['It is incumbent on Clubs, as with any other business, to assess the immediate cost savings attributable to changes in wholesales sales tax and pass those in lower prices to consumers. You rightly indicate in your circular that it will be necessary to assess the actual costs of the inputs prior to passing on the GST to members. In this regard, any overcorrection should be refunded to members.']\n",
      "[\"This means that licensed clubs like RSLs, bowling clubs and the like are confronted with a whole new layer of tax administration. So to comply with the Howard-Lees GST, clubs have first got to guess what reduction in costs might occur due to the removal of wholesale sales tax, then they have to add the GST and see what happens to prices, after which they have to calculate the difference between what they thought would happen and what actually happened. Then they have to refund the difference to the club members. On a $100 club membership subscription that might be as little as $1, but it will take a lot more time and money than that simply to work it all out. Such a burden on community based clubs may well see many of their volunteer executives giving it away under the weight of GST administration. That performance from the government's watchdog, the ACCC, should concern every community based club in Australia. It suggests that the ACCC's hotline advice simply cannot be relied upon. Secondly, like the layers of hell in Dante's Inferno, the closer clubs get to 1 July 2000 the more complex and diabolical the GST becomes.\"]\n",
      "['The other point I would make about the GST concerns petrol prices. It is increasingly dawning on motorists that the city-country gap in petrol prices must logically increase. If you cut the excise by the same amount but then add a 10 per cent GST based on different petrol prices which already exist in city-country areas, it follows mathematically that the gap between city-country petrol prices will increase. Country motorists have been sold down the river on this issue once again by the government.']\n",

      "['I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I would like to say at the beginning, having sat here and listened to the arguments of those on the other side, that they are having an absolute field day playing with the uncertainties of the general public as we go into something new. They are perpetuating inaccurate distortions in a way that is continuing this scare campaign. I have to say it is very difficult to argue with the hypothetical. They talk about fuel prices, they talk about club prices and they talk about sanitary products. They take each one individually and have a bit of a field day in some sections of the media that are willing to run these stories. But I have to say that there will be a considerable amount of egg on their faces after 1 July because at that time people will actually start to see the considerable benefits that will be available to the public through personal tax cuts. An average family will have an additional $47.50 per week in their pockets, so there will be a considerable benefit. So, although at this point in time it is difficult to argue the hypothetical, I suggest that after 1 July there will certainly be a very different argument put up by the other side. I am certainly looking forward to that day. ']\n",
      "['I do not have an opportunity to speak in this place very often on issues pertaining to areas of concern in my electorate, so I thought I would take this opportunity to raise a particular concern that I have had for some time now. It is an issue that has certainly deeply affected me in recent months in particular. At my electorate office in Cairns there is a woman who I will refer to only as Rachel who has made my staff car park her home. She lives there, she sleeps there and she rummages through industrial bins for food and items that she can convert into bedding. In front of my office is Mulgrave Road which is a main arterial road. On a regular basis she actually gets out there and stands naked in full view of the public, in full view of all the passing motorists, while she bathes under the tap. On some nights, to keep herself warm, she lights fires with newspapers in the car park. She sniffs petrol on an habitual basis. She has absolutely no respect for anything or anybody, including herself. She is abused. She is feared and loathed by normal, everyday people who are forced to put up with her presence in the car park. Sadly, I have seen young kids racing down the street throwing stones at her. A number of times I have had to actually go out and intervene. It is a very, very sad case. ']\n",
      "['Apart from being homeless, hungry, very vulnerable and in a hopeless situation, Rachel suffers a very, very serious mental illness. She is almost in a constant state of psychosis. She yells and talks incessantly to herself, yet is unable to communicate with anybody else or comprehend what is going on in the world around her. As a result, she is constantly in danger from herself and from those other vile creatures, if I can call them that, who seek to take advantage of somebody in such a vulnerable state. Not surprisingly, she trusts nobody. She could not seek help even if she realised that she needed it. My worst fear is that, one morning, either I or somebody from my electorate staff will come in and walk over the body of Rachel lying on our doorstep. In fact, it was not so long ago—about 2½ years ago, from memory—that she was actually abducted from the streets by a bogus security officer who offered her a lift, only to take her into isolated bushland. He raped her, he cut her throat and he dumped her in a nearby tidal drain to die. But she did not die because she is a survivor. The perpetrator is now serving a considerable gaol sentence for his crime. However, I have to say that where he is he has a bed, he has a roof over his head, he gets three meals day and access to training, education, medical treatment and rehabilitation, and at least he has some hope of a future for himself when he is released. That is a whole lot more than I can say for Rachel who is in a no better predicament today than she was then.']\n",
      "[\"I think, simply put, that Rachel is the kind of problem person that people do not want to know about. Tenants in the building where my office is situated complain to me to do something about it. The landlord has come to me in desperation about the problem. They want me to get her moved on so that they no longer have to put up with her antics, her bad habits and her antisocial behaviour. Quite frankly, I do not blame them. But, by the same token, we cannot blame Rachel either. The blame lies, I believe, in the system that has failed her and failed many like her. I have raised this matter with a number of colleagues and, basically, they say to me, `Well, mental health is a state issue. Why don't you take it up with your state minister?' Of course, I have. But I do not believe that that is enough. I think that Rachel's presence around my office in the last six months has served as a constant reminder, to me and to those that have been affected by what we have seen, of a failure of successive governments, both at state and federal levels, to come to terms with dealing with problems of mental health. \"]\n",
      "['Since the 1980s when the groundbreaking Burdekin report was released, the states have elected to go down the path of deinstitutionalisation for mental health sufferers. I am not suggesting that this was not the way to go. I think all of us know the horror stories that unfolded behind the closed doors of some of these mental institutions. There have been stories of neglect, of abuse and of callous disregard for quality of life, and I understand the need for a change of direction in the delivery of mental health care. ']\n",
      "['My question today is: are we doing any better? It was recognised at the time of the Burdekin report that any movements towards deinstitutionalisation would need to be made in conjunction with increased community based care to meet the demands no longer met through institutions. Whether it is through a lack of will or a lack of resources, this has simply not happened to anywhere near the extent that is needed. We have embarked on the path of deinstitutionalisation with vigour. We have sent people back into the community with absolutely nothing to equip them with regard to skills to cope with and survive in a society which does not understand them and which in many cases is afraid of them. ']\n",
      "[\"As a government I believe we have failed in our duty to care for these people and their families. We have an obligation to protect them, to support them and to help them make the transition back into the community to live as independently, as healthily and, hopefully, as normally as possible. I acknowledge that in Rachel's case if we do not move soon it is going to be too late. This is an issue that authorities have been grappling with for more than a decade. We have to move now. It is a national issue and for too long it has been bounced from one level of government to another, from one department to another. Indeed, my own investigations into Rachel's past reveal that there was not a single government agency or department in Cairns that was not aware of her plight. But for one reason or another they were unable to offer any assistance. Her case has been pushed from one agency to the next, with the final result being that nobody—absolutely nobody—in Cairns, a city of some 130,000 people, was prepared to take any responsibility. \"]\n",
      "['Police officers have told me that it is not an offence to sniff petrol. They come along almost daily—I sympathise with the police—they evict her from the property and they lock her up in the watchhouse because she is being a nuisance. This is a constant frustration for the police because they are not equipped to deal with these sorts of problems. The next day they have to let her back out and she is back on the streets. So the same problem exists. She has been admitted and assessed by the Integrated Mental Health Unit at the Cairns Base Hospital but, once again, nobody can make her seek treatment. She can walk out the door any time she pleases. As is the case with drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, nobody can force a person to undergo treatment, even if that person is not capable of making decisions about their own wellbeing. ']\n",
      "[\"I understand that the Queensland government is considering a number of reforms of the mental health bill that will go some way towards assisting in the facilitation of early and appropriate access for the involuntary treatment of people with mental illness. We have to address this as an issue right across the board. This is not something that should be left just to the states' own devices. The federal government, which provides a lot of funds in this area, also needs to take a very active role in dealing with these problems and helping to offer solutions. In the case of anybody suffering as Rachel does it takes a terrible toll on their family and friends, who are doing their utmost to support their loved one, and in many cases without any professional help if that victim refuses to accept assistance. \"]\n",
      "['It would appear obvious to me that the closure of psychiatric hospitals and wards and other designated mental health institutions has left a huge void in the support network available to those suffering a mental illness. There is a desperate need in Cairns, and many other places, I am sure, for some form of supported accommodation with supervision by a suitably qualified person. We cannot expect people living with mental illnesses to make the difficult transition into the community without a safety net in place to provide ongoing support along the way. Until this is achieved, people with mental illness will continue to be feared and ostracised by communities ill equipped to understand their problems and without the resources or facilities to care for, protect and support them.  ']\n",
      "['We need to move now. I use the example of Rachel, but I have many examples. I will use another example now and, while it may be graphic for this place, I think it is necessary to highlight the extent of the problem. I attended a meeting not so long ago about the provision of accommodation for people with mental illness. I walked outside during the evening to stretch my legs and met a young lass who was probably about 23 or 24 years old. She was quite well dressed. She came out and tried to explain to me her problem. She was a mental health patient who was living in a unit on her own and she had no support. One of her problems was that every so often she would get the wanders. She would wander down through the Esplanade in Cairns and places like that. She had no control over her own actions and she was being used and abused by people in the parks. She was aware of what was happening. She was petrified that she was going to catch something which would have serious implications for her health, but she had no control over that. She had nobody in supported accommodation to stop her from doing that. ']\n",
      "['Things like that are really starting to frighten me. I could go on about Rachel. She has a tendency to raid the printing office next door. She pulls out the old toners and paints herself with black toner. Then she will paint her eyes with purple toner and wander around like that. I do not know what sorts of health implications painting yourself with toner is going to have, but I am sure it is not healthy and it tends to ostracise her. She has no control. We need to seriously look at the situation. It is not just in Cairns. We have to put more emphasis on the mental health outreach work that we do as well. I have dealt here predominantly with my own personal experiences in Cairns, to highlight the gaping hole in service delivery, but this is by no means a problem confined to urban areas.']\n",
      "['As recently as this week, I received representation from health professionals despairing at the complete lack of support for those suffering mental illness throughout Cape York. Alcohol addiction excluded, the lack of counselling services in Cape York was rated as the single biggest issue of concern in the delivery of indigenous health services. A person to whom I spoke described a recent incident where he and other personnel were virtually begging for help in dealing with a very severe case involving a young lad at Kowanyama. The lad was carrying a gun around the community and threatening to blow his head off. The mental health agencies in Cairns were unable to respond—and, guess what: the kid blew his head off in a public place in full view of friends and relatives. Apparently, this shocking incident is still not enough to convince the relevant authorities that there needs to be some grief and trauma counselling in the community—some sort of mental health response unit—for those people deeply affected by traumas such as this tragedy.']\n",
      "['When I first came into this place, I was asked to vote on an intervention in the Northern Territory with regard to euthanasia legislation because it was felt that the federal government had a role to intervene and to be involved. We are now discussing the possibility of some intervention with regard to mandatory sentencing in a state and a territory. Of course, the media is screaming for us to do something. It is continually highlighting a case of a death in custody of a 15-year-old lad from the Northern Territory. But we see nothing in the media about the youngster who blew his head off in full public view on the streets of Kowanyama because there was no response from the state mental health authorities to be able to support him. If there is any need for Commonwealth intervention, then I believe it is not so much in going in and being heavy handed but offering support, financial resources and direction so that we get some sort of a national program to start to deal with these problems. I certainly believe that this is an excellent example of why we should be intervening.']\n",

That is why I am telling Rachel's story in this place today. It is time that each and every one of us extracted our heads from the sand and faced up to the mental health crisis that is unfolding across this nation. As I said, Rachel is somebody's daughter. I would say that every single member in this House has many Rachels in their electorate. There would hardly be a town or a city in this country that does not have a Rachel. It is my view that we need to start taking these cases out of the too-hard basket and putting them back into our in-tray. We cannot continue to ignore the problem or feel secure in the knowledge that it is somebody else's responsibility. Imagine for one moment if Rachel were your daughter and then tell me that nothing can be done to help her or people like her. I do not think that there is anybody in this chamber who believes we cannot do better. I, for one, intend to keep pushing until we do, and I would encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the House to join me on this one.

      "#######\n",
      "[\"In this consideration of the budget, I rise to speak on the government's appalling handling of the housing sector in relation to the implementation of the GST. Housing, of course, has long been recognised as one of the essentials of life. It is certainly one of the basic rights that we expect an Australian government to protect in advance. Not only is a roof over our heads fundamental but it also has a major impact on our health, on our ability to gain an education and, indeed, on how well off we are as human beings. Under those circumstances, why would a government want to erode this right? We heard a lot of rhetoric during the election campaign which suggested, for example, that rents would be GST free. We also heard a lot of rhetoric that the impact on housing would be minimal. The fact is that the opposite is the case. Sectors of the housing industry—the Housing Industry Association, tenants' unions, real estate agents, construction industry bodies, public housing associations, the state housing ministers—are unanimous in their conviction that the GST will make housing more expensive. By making it more expensive, this mean-spirited government will force more disadvantaged Australians onto the streets. We have already seen indications that the number of homeless in Australia is over 100,000 people on any night. The government's reaction to that has been to reannounce on no fewer than five occasions the same funding for the homeless. The impact of the GST on housing will impact on the ability of people to buy a new house; it will impact on private renters; it will impact on strata titleholders; it will impact on public housing; and it will also impact on residents in boarding houses, caravan parks and holiday villages.\"]\n",
      "['First of all, I want to talk about the impact on new home buyers. The GST will apply to new home building, land development, renovations, additions, repairs and maintenance. None of the compensation packages offered by the government, such as the First Home Owners Scheme, come anywhere near making a first home more affordable for the average Australian family. The $7,000 up-front payment to first home buyers proposed by the government would only adequately compensate for homes valued up to $90,000. You would be very lucky to find a house in Sydney or Melbourne that sells for $90,000. The Urban Development Institute of Australia predicts that a house-land package costing $230,000, which is more like the median price for houses in Sydney, will cost $248,500 under the GST. The $7,000 up-front payment does not even meet half the GST costs. It is extraordinary that members could suggest that first home buyers in any of the capital cities in Australia, particularly those on the east coast, will actually be able to purchase a home within a price of $90,000.']\n",
      "[\"We hear the Treasurer trot out the argument that the removal of the wholesale sales tax will somehow also compensate home builders. But what are the facts? The Urban Development Institute of Australia has estimated that the wholesale sales tax on the average new home is less than $1,000. This is against the GST on a medium priced Sydney home of $24,728. That means a shortfall of some $23,000, just for a medium priced home. Another respected investment analysis body, BIS Shrapnel, in their report `Impact of the GST on the Australian residential building markets', have calculated the GST on house-land packages as follows: Sydney $14,200 minimum, Canberra $10,600, Melbourne $10,400, Brisbane $10,200, Perth $9,800, Adelaide $7,100 and Hobart $6,700. So, according to BIS Shrapnel, if you are a first home buyer and you are buying a house and land package, in every capital city on mainland Australia the $7,000 compensation simply will not be enough. They go on to state that the major losers from the impact of the GST on the residential sector will be first home buyers of new dwellingsin particular, first home buyers in Sydney and Melbourne. Furtherand here is the crucial pointthe proposed $7,000 First Home Owners Scheme payment will not compensate these buyers for new dwelling costs in both cities. \"]\n",
      "['As well, there is evidence which has been well documented that, because the GST is coming in on 1 July, there is a massive rush to build homes before then. There is a consequential massive increase in the costs of labour and materials as the demand exceeds the supply. We have seen a massive one-off increase—one estimate is up to $60,000 extra cost—in the cost of building a home now because of that non-equating of demand with supply and the pressure which is building on people to get all of the work out of the way before 1 July. There is also an economic impact. At the moment, there is a big boom going on but a big bust will occur after 1 July, a cyclical economic impact which will be negative in terms of jobs and in terms of growth.']\n",
      "[\"I want to also turn to private renters. If you look at the private rental market, landlords are precluded from levying the GST on rents yet they will pay GST on their inputs, leaving them with the choice of wearing the costs themselves or putting up rents. Who thinks that landlords will say, `Oh well, we'll just absorb the costs and get less profit,' particularly in a market situation where there is a massive housing shortage and an affordability crisis in the cities around Australia? The fact is that this will be used as a one-off excuse to put up rents to a massive degree. Tenants are therefore faced with paying that increased rent. The New South Wales Federation of Housing Associations predicts that the GST could increase rents in Sydney by some $20 to $30 per week. Rate rises forced by the GST will further fuel rent increases. Some councils will spend up to $100,000 on GST set-up costs, forcing them to look at rate rises and, when they put their rates up, rents will inevitably follow.\"]\n",

When you look at the GST tax cuts, they will not even begin to compensate renters for increased rents, and that is before they start paying for the other necessities of life. You also have real estate agents passing the GST on maintenance costs directly to the tenant. Agents are writing into rental agreements that the GST component on basic maintenance will be paid by the tenant. So if you live in a run-down private rental home, as a lot of disadvantaged people do, you will have to pay to get basic services maintained. What choice do tenants face? It is either pay the GST or live in a house without plumbing or with broken doors or broken windows. \"]\n",
      "['I want to now go on to strata title holders. They are people who are already paying the GST, because the second half component of their bills for this year contains the GST. The member for Mitchell might laugh, but that is 1.1 million Australians who have such a bill to pay at the moment. Many of these are older Australians on fixed incomes who will be forced to pay the GST on strata levies. Strata schemes have been forced to levy the GST, track the GST on goods and services purchased and then fight their way through the paperwork to claim back tax credits. All this was supposed to be a simplification of the tax system. Many of these strata schemes are not large bodies, and it is these bodies who will have to administer this system. For 1.1 million people, paying taxes is about to get a whole lot more complicated. The fact is that, in just about every single example of a strata title in Australia, even though the input taxes will be able to be claimed back, they are getting a substantial increase in their levies—certainly well beyond the 2.3 per cent increase in rents that was estimated by the government.']\n",
      "['So we have first home buyers and new home purchasers being done over, we have private renters being done over and we have people in strata titles being done over—but if you slipped through the net you had the public housing safety net. But public housing funding will also be slashed under this GST. To take one state, Queensland, the GST will mean an effective reduction of $30 million in public housing funds over the life of the current Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. There will be further additional costs to public housing. Maintenance costs do not currently attract sales tax. They will, however, attract the GST. That means it will cost an extra 10 per cent to keep public housing states in a livable condition. Due to the nature of public housing in Australia where you have a lot of old stock, increasingly a lot of the budget is used up simply in maintenance. That will mean a massive effective cut in the amount of money available not only to do up older residences but also to invest in new homes.']\n",
      "['The impact of the GST must also be seen against the backdrop of cuts to public housing funding since this government was elected. Since the first Howard budget, federal government outlays for CSHA grants and rent assistance have decreased by 10 per cent. The government has been relying more upon rent assistance as a way of delivering housing assistance. This, however, does not benefit public housing tenants, it does not help people in areas of low housing supply and it does not help people who face discrimination in the private rental market—for example, those with disabilities. State governments know what the GST means: a huge millstone around the neck of public housing.

But, as a result of this government's legislation, people who live in caravan parks are going to be forced to pay the GST: 10 per cent on the first 27 days and then five per cent after that. People in boarding houses will be hit with the same. Some 161,000 people are living in caravan parks.

      "[\"Speaker after speaker from the Labor Party has tried to raise this false apparition of how dreadful the goods and services tax will be. I will take a couple of simple examples from the previous member's comments. He was talking about new homes with an average value of $250,000—I think they were the figures he used; I will be generous to him—in the Sydney area. He claimed that, by the time you removed $1,000 of wholesale sales tax and put on a goods and services tax, a person buying a new home in the Sydney area spending $290,000 would have to pay an additional $14,200—I think they were the words he used—only half of which he said would be covered by the first home buyers $7,000 one-off payment, leaving a deficit to be met by the first home purchaser of some $7,200. That works out at about $8 a week on normal interest rates.\"]\n",

If you take those figures, and if they are accurate, that is approximately $8 extra a week that person would have to pay to borrow $7,200 to cover the additional cost due to a goods and services tax. But that family with one child will be receiving tax cuts of $50 a week, which will more than adequately cover any increase in the purchase of their home. In addition, they get the $7,000 first home buyer payment. ']\n",

The small businesses of Australia will have a basic return with everything on it. They will have a pay-as-you-go system; they will be rid of nine taxes which are debilitating, costly, time consuming, bureaucratic, difficult to administer and ramshackle in their application. The goods and services tax is a single tax replacing all of these taxes, plus a simplified tax return on just one sheet of paper']\n",

The business activity sheet is prepared by the small business proprietor or by any business proprietor on one sheet of paper and returned once a quarter after they know what their income is. There is none of the predictions or guesstimates that occur with some of the other taxes that we have had. The prospect for many of getting rid of the prescribed payments tax or the portable payments tax, these inventions of minds that say, `We must do everything to protect the revenue no matter how much it may cost the taxpayer'let us protect the revenue but let us give some regard to the cost of the taxpayer of complianceis important. If we are competitive with our international competitors, we gain an advantage. If our tax system is simpler and easier to administer, we gain a competitive advantage in a global sense. \"]\n",

The $200 comes and you can boost that up with a company like Mind Your Own Business to mean much more than the raw $200 in a business. There is time required to make the change, but it is not a difficult change for most businesses. ']\n",
      "[\"So the impact of the change to the goods and services tax is very much as predicted by my colleague across the chamber and by the former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating. We do need to change the tax system in Australia. It is too complex, it is uncompetitive and it dampens the enthusiasm and incentive of the average working person. It is too much loaded on pay as you earn taxation and not enough on pay as you spend. So people need the incentive to be able to set their own goals, set their own visions, whether it be to start a business or to build a house, whether it be to become an exporter or to become an entertainer. Whatever their goal might be, they should not be discouraged by extraordinarily high taxes from doing that. That is something that the current taxation system does discourage. One only has to look at the statistics for the last year available. This publication, `Taxation Statistics 1997-98', was received by me on 4 January this year. Look at the massive increases in things like capital gains over the last five or six years—going back to about 1993, when things suddenly started to bite. Company taxation started to increase dramatically from that period. \"]\n",

That was their argument, that food would be dearereven though there was no goods and services tax on foodunder the new regime and everything would be terrible. I think the weekend press put that to rest. Of course, there would be members who are aware of the statements published this week in Choice magazine about the GST changes and the food products that will be down, those that will remain the same and those that will be slightly increased. That further demonstrates that the figures at the weekend in the popular press which said that there would be a slight decrease in the average food basket are maintained and verified.\"]\n",
      "['So much for those arguments. They have gone by the board. What are we arguing now? That the tax office has a few problems in starting the new things up and fallaciouslythat small businesses cannot handle this. I think all of those old arguments one by one are being knocked over, belted out and dispensed with because, as people understand the changes, they are starting to see the logic of what the changes are. The Morgan and Banks survey, for instance, indicated very clearly that business in Australia was far from being in a state of panic, far from being unprepared. Their survey of over 3,200 businesses in regard to tax reform showed that, with four months to go until 1 July, 91.4 per cent of businesses are confident of being prepared for the new tax system. In every state the result was over 90 per cent. In small business, 91.2 per cent are more confident than big business. So the arguments just collapse under the weight of facts. The arm waving of some members and the invented arguments of others do not bear real scrutiny. It was very interesting to note in the Morgan and Banks survey that the media industry is least confident about being prepared. To be exact, 82.4 per cent of the media are confident that they are ready. I guess some of them are so busy writing bad news stories about this that they have convinced themselves that it is difficult. But the administrators of the media should be quite confident in what they are doing. I frankly do not understand that difference. The details of that Morgan and Banks survey are freely available to members and to anybody in the public who wants to know how it will work.']\n",
      "[\"If one looks at the Australian economy generally, one would have to say we are faring well as a nation but we have to keep our attention and focus well on the future—changes in taxation will bring benefits; further reforms are needed both to industrial relations and to the processes by which we pay welfare. I think that is generally and broadly acknowledged, but how we get there will be a matter of dispute. So looking ahead to tax change, we need to be conscious of national goals that need to be staked out at this time. We need to be aware that in general the economy will continue to perform at its current level, that the level of employment will continue to increase. If one looks at the survey of Australian manufacturing business for the Australian Industry Group, one finds that production for the last quarter has increased by 16 per cent, and demand is positive with an increase of 17 per cent. So there are substantial factors there proved by the Australian group and Pricewaterhouse, proved again by the ACCI and the Westpac Banking Corporation, on the capacity that we have to use our factories in an economic way, to use the full-time labour available to work in factories or on farms. The public of Australia continue to want things and have the confidence to buy. Housewives and families say, `Yes, we can continue to spend at this level and we do not have to pull back at this time. We are confident enough to go on as we are.' There is a strong new order delivery line-up. In fact, most businesses are indicating that there are delays in filling their orders.  \"]\n",
      "[\"What does all this say? That Australia is going reasonably well. We are having tax reform, we are having the Olympic Games and what comes next? I think that we continually need a challenge. I think that the next challenges that we ought to look at are how we deal with the demand on infrastructure and how we deal with welfare. These are the next two tests for this country. I hope my colleague opposite offers some suggestions in that debate. My own view is that in welfare we need a welfare net and not a hammock. We need to be able to provide through agencies of government continual transfer payments that allow people to have basic, comfortable, reasonable living standards if they fall on hard times. But in addition to that, I think we ought to be moving ahead, as this government has started to, to provide services which are more comprehensive and more compassionate through agencies other than government agencies. There are many avenues by which this can be done. The minister for employment services came under criticism over the Christmas period for selecting so-called Christian agencies. That minister in my assessment picked agencies that produced the goods. They got contracts because they delivered. They could actually get people into work and the contracts that they won are the type of contracts that required them to get people into work and they were prepared to go the extra miles and spend the extra time and make sure that that happened. That should be the test, and that was the test that was applied. But it is a narrow area to which we are applying welfare reform at this stage. We need to enlarge that and spread it into handicapped services, children's services, services to the aged. I am sure it is not beyond the wit of this Australian parliament to reach those conclusions. Let us hope there can be some consensus of opinion about the results.\"]\n",
      "['In regard to infrastructure, things like the careful reinvestment of our resources, whether it be by sale of Telstra or whatever, the careful reinvestment of resources into providing for the future, making our communications more efficient, building Internet contact around Australia and being prepared to accept that nobody in Australia should pay more than a local telephone call for an emailed message will bring Australia together, will cut the tyranny of distance and will let those people in remote areas communicate with the rest of Australia at no cost. That is the infrastructure building that we should be embarking on. The goods and services tax and the change in the tax regime is being legislated for. It is going through the parliament. To try to torpedo it and say it is a mess and nobody understands it is in fact a failure to understand the very basics. It is well thought through; it is logical. There are answers across the board for all factors of it. For those that need assistance, there is a plethora of information available.']\n",

Then there are 31 industry specific books. Whether it be in horticultural, cropping or livestock, whether it be for welfare agencies or charitable organisations, these easily readable booklets are there. There is a second round of education programs being done by the tax office right now, starting over these next weeks. There is web site presentation where all the material that is published is available.

      "[\"Many of the outlays in these two appropriation bills relate to regional development. I want to address this question of regional policy and specifically look at four of the myths that seem to spread throughout the debate about regional development in Australia. The first of those myths is that there is an economic rationalist conspiracy to destroy the bush. I have always been under the impression that industries in regional Australia are largely market based and they rely on market forces to produce wealth and prosperity. In fact, I grew up with the rhetoric that Australia's agriculture and mining industries are among the most competitive in the world. Of course, we know they are the backbone of our export industries.\"]\n",
      "['So these things are true, and they have been the case in Australia for a long time. If the industries are so competitive globally and are so good at exporting, it begs the question why there are so many demands for government handouts. It is my opinion that normally these demands come from those who in the past have accumulated wealth and privilege from market forces and now, because of the dynamic nature of the market, are seeing those privileges wither away, so they make the political protest. Any sensible Australian farmer and any resident in the bush knows these truths. They know the reality of the market system, the pluses, the minuses and the constant need for upgrading and adjustment.']\n",
      "['It is very interesting to note that one industry has actually voted on these matters in recent times. There was a democratic vote in a rural industry about whether they wanted excessive regulation of the market or they wanted deregulation policy. The dairy farmers in Victoria voted 89 per cent in favour of deregulation. It is my guess that, if they had voted 89 per cent against, there would have been banner headlines in the media saying there was a revolt in rural Australia against market forces. But in fact they voted 89 per cent in favour and you can barely find the story at the bottom of page 10 of any newspaper. You never hear the members for Kennedy or Dawson saying a word about such a vote and such a democratic outcome expressed by the dairy farmers in Victoria. So I expose as myth the idea that there is some economic rationalist conspiracy to destroy the bush. The bush has long relied on market forces and in the absence of any sensible alternative it will long do so into the future.']\n",
      "['The second myth I address is the suggestion that the great locational imbalance in Australia is between the city and the country. I acknowledge that imbalances and inequities do exist. There is an imbalance between employment and economic opportunities in the city and those in the bush, but it is not as great as the imbalance between the inner city and the outer suburbs. It is not as great as the differences within metropolitan areas. I invite any government members who doubt this assertion to visit the public housing estates in my electorate or in the electorate of my colleague the member for Chifley to find out for themselves the extreme level of social exclusion and social disadvantage. I invite them to come and visit suburbs and neighbourhoods with unemployment rates of 50 per cent—not 10 or 15 per cent, which is often the claim in regional Australia—and welfare dependency rates of 80 per cent. That is where you will discover real social exclusion.']\n",
      "['We have had the Prime Minister on his regional tour. Where is the tour of public housing estates to visit the people who are most grossly excluded from participation in this country? These are the forgotten suburbs in this debate. They are the forgotten neighbourhoods in Australian public policy. These areas are not in marginal seats. A lot of the noise about regional Australia is driven by political considerations and most of the marginal seats for the next federal election campaign are located in non-metropolitan areas. These suburbs do not provide the residences for journalists, bureaucrats or opinion leaders so they get neglected in the public arena.  ']\n",
      "['In many ways, the socially excluded have become institution free. The people who live in these concentrated areas of long-term unemployment and welfare dependency are institution free. They are not connected to the growth in the small business sector. They are not connected to trade unions and other parts of the labour movement. They are certainly not connected to some of the coffee shop socialists who would pretend to know about their cause. The big challenge is to recognise these realities, and this is a huge challenge on my side of politics. We in the Labor Party started out as the political wing of the trade union movement. Now as we move from industrial to information age politics we need to become the political wing of the socially excluded. This is a very important shift in our institutional structure and purpose, but one that needs to be made.']\n",
      "['The third myth I address in this debate about regional Australia concerns the suggestion that government handouts are the answer. This is a suggestion which is simplistic. It is a suggestion which defies the root causes of economic change and adjustment in regional Australia. The truth is that we now operate in a vastly new economy. All the economic rules are being rewritten every day as the economic fundamentals and investments change. In this new economy investment has become mobile and investors place a huge premium on skills. So it stands to reason that in the new economy the investments and the jobs tend to follow the locations that have the strongest skills. Investment and employment are drawn to those areas that offer the best return on the skills of workers and the skills of entrepreneurs. ']\n",
      "['We need to give weak areas struggling with economic adjustment a comparative advantage in education and skills. For instance, I recently advanced a plan for free regional universities in Australia. This is what I mean by a comparative advantage in education and skills. We need to recognise that many people in regional Australia flock to the cities for their education. They stay and work there and that of course is part of the pull towards metropolitan areas. In Tasmania it is known as the brain drain, whereby the best and brightest of their young people are drawn to Sydney and Melbourne for education and as a result the state of Tasmania suffers. We need to turn around the brain drain and turn around the incentive system in regional Australia. We need to give the bush a comparative advantage in education and skills, and that means driving down the comparative cost of education in regional Australia. ']\n",
      "['I am a strong advocate of a mixed funding system for universities. One size fits all is the politics of the industrial age. It will not suit the new politics and the new realities of the information age. We should have a mixed, diverse university system and part of that should be cost free regional universities. Let us target those parts of Australia that have got the weakest rates of investment and the highest rates of unemployment and give them a lower cost for educating the best and brightest of their young people and even draw in some from the city. So you reverse the pull towards the city and use education and mixed systems of funding to produce better outcomes in regional development.']\n",
      "['This highlights a very important point for policy makers. I mentioned earlier that the new economy is rewriting all the economic rules, and so it is. Part of the responsibility here for policy entrepreneurs and policy makers in this parliament is to devise the new rules. In economics we need to think beyond micro- and macro-economics; we have to start to think about a third approach—spatial economics. We have to recognise that the key indicators of social disadvantage are skills and location. Postcodes are becoming the best guide to the opportunities that people have got in this country. ']\n",
      "['Economics as a profession and as a practice in this parliament needs to adjust. We need a serious debate on these issues. We really do not want—and I would hate to see this—the fastest growing industry in regional Australia to be whingeing. We do not want a culture of complaint. We want a political culture of answers in regional Australia. So whingeing should be out and answers need to come in. The debate needs to be a lot more serious than it has been in the past.  ']\n",
      "['I give an example concerning a proposal that I do not necessarily agree with. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, came up with the idea before Christmas that there should be a bit more flexibility in regional labour markets. A lot of serious economists advocate such a plan. Even the head of the New South Wales Labor Council, Michael Costa, has advocated such a plan in one of his books. As I said, I do not necessarily agree with the proposal, but the manner in which it was dismissed was very disconcerting for those who want a serious debate about the issues in regional Australia instead of a culture of complaint. The truth is that hysteria and political opportunism will never be a substitute for informed debate and informed policy making. So let us not have these knee-jerk political reactions. When someone puts up a serious proposal about helping the bush, let us have a decent debate about the ideas on offer.']\n",
      "['The fourth myth in this debate about regional Australia concerns the suggestion that financial interests in the city have got it in for the bush. Following the recent increase in interest rates, I was stunned to hear my otherwise learned friend the member for Wannon making such a suggestion. He is not just a contributor in the parliament; he holds the prestigious position of chairman of the parliamentary economics committee. Yet this is what he had to say in response to the recent 0.5 per cent increase in interest rates:']\n",
      "['Many commodity prices are at decade lows and many regions still have unacceptably high unemployment. Yet the Sydney-dominant bank economists have bullied the Reserve Bank of Australia into pushing up rates to the detriment of the rest of the country ...']\n",

      "['That in fact is self-serving populism and political opportunism of the worst kind. That is just absolute economic claptrap. As the chairman of the economics committee, the member for Wannon should have known that the interest rate rise was almost certain. We had a parliamentary inquiry involving the head of the Reserve Bank late last year and on every indicator you could have bet your house that interest rates were going to rise in the new year—growing capacity constraints, a tighter labour market, strong consumer spending, increased household indebtedness, a weaker currency, higher international interest rates, higher than expected economic growth globally, a steepening yield curve in Australia, the Olympics boom, the excessive fiscal stimulation that this government is introducing in July as part of its GST package and the deteriorating budget position under this government. Each and every one of those indicators showed that interest rates were going to rise in the new year. So here is the government feigning horror and shock that they have gone up by half a per cent, and the member for Wannon indulging in the stupidity of trying to blame market economists in the city. That was a cheap piece of political populism, one that is not deserving of the important issues in this debate.']\n",
      "[\"The main point is this: the increase in interest rates was not due to bankers in Sydney; it was due to policy makers in Canberra. A lot of the complaints of the member for Wannon should be sheeted home to his own backyard. He should be worried about the nature of this government's economic policies which are directly driving up interest rates and increasing the financial burden on debt-strapped Australian homes. I see a few members opposite shaking their heads. Let them consider these facts. Under this government national savings have been anchored at a low level. This government promised huge increases in national savings and after four years they have barely moved. That is one of the reasons why interest rates have gone up. And household savings are at an all-time low, yet this government has absolutely no inkling of a household savings policy.\"]\n",
      "[\"The other aspect of this government's failing on interest rates is its fiscal irresponsibility. I pay tribute to the member for Kingston, who last night belled the cat on this government's fiscal irresponsibility. He produced statistics showing that the seven-year effect of four Costello budgets is to worsen the Commonwealth fiscal position by $10.7 billion. The member for Kingston makes the valid point: \"]\n",
      "['The Treasurer by his fiscal laxity has allowed all of the $8 billion worth of savings he achieved in his first budget to be wiped out. The net effect of all the policy decisions taken since the 1996 budget has been to dissipate the annual savings made in that budget.']\n",
      "[\"I refer members to the member for Kingston's presentation in the House and the table that was incorporated in Hansard. It shows that, over the four budgets of this government, the seven-year effect has been to worsen the financial position of the Commonwealth by almost $11 billion. Then the member for Kingston went on to point out that the 1999-2000 budget papers show that Commonwealth underlying own purpose outlays as a percentage of GDP have risen from 20.5 per centthe level at Labor's last budgetto an estimated 21.4 per cent. Commonwealth own purpose outlays as a percentage of GDP are up by one per cent.\"]\n",

The IMF also said that `fiscal policy has also sought to improve economic efficiency through a landmark tax reform package and more recent business tax proposals.' The IMF described that landmark tax reform package as `improving the integrity and fairness of the tax system and reducing its complexity'. That is a direct endorsement by the International Monetary Fund of the government's policy in relation to tax reform.

I make this point: just as the Labor Party fought every step of the way against fiscal consolidation and then said it was in favour of surplus budgets, so now it intends to fight every step of the way against tax reform and, if it ever gets elected, do you know what it intends to do with the GST? It intends to keep it. It intends to fight every step of the way and then to take the benefit of it. That is straight and complete opportunism. It is an elaborate cover for a failure to come to grips with any meaningful policy. The runs are on the board; the international organisations have endorsed the government's stand. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition, if he thinks he is a modern thinker, to produce one international body, an IMF or an OECD, that recommends the abolition of value added tax and the introduction of wholesale sales tax. I ask him to produce just one international endorsement of his policy to show that he is in step with somebody in the world, other than the countries of Botswana and Swaziland.\"]\n",

It is in line with inflation which, for health care, is a very good effort, given that overseas—in the United States and the United Kingdom—premiums are going up in the order of 10 per cent a year. It has been a lot of hard work and compares to a figure of a 17 per cent increase in just one year under Labor in 1991-92.

Australia is the greatest share owning nation in the world. As of today, 54 per cent of adult Australians now directly or indirectly own shares—that is, 7.6 million Australians—and 41 per cent of the adult population directly own shares. That is up from just 20 per cent in May 1997. Certainly, share ownership in Australia has surged under the Howard government. Much of the credit is due to the privatisation of Telstra. Telstra has 2.1 million shareholders and in Telstra tranche 2, overseen by the Minister for Finance and Administration, 321,000 people for the very first time became share owners. ']\n",

The member for Werriwa, who has been good enough to join us in the House today, would have you believe, as he said in a speech in this House last year, that only the top end of town has shares. That is incorrect because 54 per cent of all Australian adults own shares, either directly or indirectly. The good news in this announcement is that, in households with an income of less than $30,000 a year, 22 per cent directly own shares. In households with incomes of between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, 39 per cent directly own shares. So it is not a privilege for the rich; it is particularly a privilege for working Australians. This is also reflected across regions. Forty-two per cent of adults in metropolitan Australia and 39 per cent in regional Australia own shares, which is up from 28 per cent in October 1998. That sort of increase in share ownership is directly attributable to the policies of the government. ']\n",

While that article is correct, people should not take that as being the case right around Australia. The issue of attracting doctors to rural Australia is one where federal and state governments interplay. The results around the country are patchy because different state governments approach it in different manners. When we look at the years 1997-98—I have not yet seen the figures for 1999—we find that, in rural Australia, the number of doctors providing a service under Medicare went up 5.3 per cent over those two years. That is a good result and certainly it turns around a 30-year decline. However, when we look at New South Wales we find that the number of doctors in that state went up only 1.9 per cent. New South Wales had the lowest increase of any state in Australia. Tasmania achieved a 20 per cent increase in the number of rural doctors; South Australia, 9.4; Queensland, 5.3; Western Australia, 4.8; Victoria, 4.6; and New South Wales, 1.9. Similarly, with remote area doctors, in that same period—1997-98—the number of doctors providing a service under Medicare went up nearly 20 per cent. In New South Wales it was 5.7 per cent only. Some governments, notably the Queensland government, have had great success. In 1998 the number of doctors in remote Queensland went up 20 per cent. This was due to the very commendable efforts of the former health minister, Mike Horan—efforts, to be fair, that have been continued since he showed the leadership to get doctors into rural Australia.']\n",
      "[\"On the federal government's part, the single most important thing we did was bring in the so-called provider number legislation which enabled temporary resident doctors, overseas trained doctors and recent graduates to get experience in rural Australia when they would not have been able to practise in urban centres. It also means that the doctor in rural Australia who comes here saying that they wish to practise in rural Australia has to actually keep that commitment. We did not have the capacity to do that previously. We now have state-based rural work force agencies in every state of Australia. Rural retention payments were introduced just before Christmas for the first time to reward doctors who were already in rural areas. This Christmas we will have 600 medical students around rural and remote Australia on John Flynn scholarships. We have a university Department of Rural Health starting at Wagga. This year the James Cook University at Townsville is starting a medical school. The member for Herbert can take a lot of credit for that. The Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme is providing scholarships to get more young country kids into medicine and in this respect the numbers of country kids in med school have been going up very substantially. There is no easy or quick solution here, and I do very much want to work with state governments.

One could hardly expect a question on the whole issue of compensation to be dealt with by any manner other than the way in which the Leader of the House is currently dealing with it, indicating precisely what the government's policy will be.  \"]\n",
      "['I point out by way of aside that we have had 17 points of order today, and not one of them has been a fair point of order going to any issue under the standing orders. But in respect of these particular workers, we have made contact with them. We are now trying to ascertain the facts so that we can understand whether or not they are eligible. Furthermore, I can advise the House that I have written to my counterpart in New South Wales, Mr Geoff Shaw, the Minister for Industrial Relations. I have advised him of the approach that we will be taking, and I have asked him to advise me what approach the New South Wales government will be taking. This provides an opportunity for the Labor Party to do something to help these workers. The minister has before him a request from us to know what New South Wales is doing but I hear not one member of the Labor Party calling on the New South Wales government to stand up and participate in a scheme which will contribute to the welfare of these workers. It does not have a policy on these Scone workers any more than it has had a policy on any other workers in the last few years, let alone in its 13 years in government. The New South Wales Minister for Gaming and Racing has been prepared to take up this issue. My challenge to you blokes is to finally do something constructive on behalf of these workers. ']\n",

      "[\"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Has the minister seen reports that the Queensland government is demanding the federal government pay compensation to landholders affected by the state's new tree clearing laws? What is the federal government's response to this matter, and will the government ensure that farmers are adequately consulted by the Queensland government and then adequately compensated by that state government? \"]\n",
      "#######\n",
      "[\"I spent some time last week with the honourable member for Groom in his electorate. Everywhere we went—indeed, everywhere you go in country Queensland—landholders are angry about the way in which the Beattie Labor government has trampled on their rights in forcing legislation through the Queensland parliament in the dying days before Christmas, introducing draconian new land clearing laws without any proper consultation with the rural sector. This is typical of Labor's approach to vital rural issues, trying to accentuate the divide between country and city, sitting in their city allotments, which are exempt from Labor's new land clearing laws, and passing judgment on the activities of farmers. Beattie's attempts to portray farmers as environmental vandals are utterly offensive and have certainly deeply affected rural and regional Australia, which was quite apparent in Winton over the weekend. The reality is that farmers are overwhelmingly conscious of their obligations to care for their land and they find the treatment by the Labor government in Queensland offensive. \"]\n",
      "[\"Also remarkable about the Labor government's decision, in a state that is always very keen to emphasise states' rights—and the state does have constitutional responsibility for land management issues —is that the moment they stuff it all up and make a botch of their laws, they demand the Commonwealth pick up the bill. What has happened is that landholders, many of whom have been paying money to the state government for years to freehold their land, now have their rights restricted and the state government has no plans in place for compensation. Late one Saturday evening they faxed Senator Hill demanding that he produce $103 million in 48 hours—no justification; $103 million in 48 hours. I know Premier Beattie can find money to fund secret deals with Virgin Airlines and the like overnight, but this government has a responsible approach to financial management. There was no justification for the $103 million. Indeed, the state government shredded their own report, which put the cost of that compensation very much higher than they had previously admitted.  \"]\n",
      "['So the laws were rapidly pushed through parliament just in time for a big TV advertising campaign to commence on Brisbane television. So there was plenty of money for television advertising, and plenty of money for Virgin Airlines, but no money for compensation for the rights they were trampling on. It is clearly ridiculous that the Queensland government should expect the federal government to pick up the bill for their land clearing laws. They need to talk to the farm owners and the landholders in a responsible and genuine way. They need to get workable and reasonable laws. Once Mr Beattie has done those things, then he can start thinking about coming to Canberra to talk to us about what sort of an involvement we should have. His behaviour in this issue has been appalling. He has treated the landholders in Queensland with absolute contempt. It is time that he started taking responsibility for his own decisions. ']\n",

Do the guidelines require the relevant department to accept, as you did in the case of National Textiles, the administrator's views about the best way in which the government should provide its assistance, including, if appropriate, support for any proposed deed of arrangement? If these guidelines have not developed, why should these administrators and the workers they are seeking to protect be treated any differently from National Textiles? \"]\n",

We know the reason why interest rates essentially go up: it is because inflation goes up. We know that there has been anticipation of inflation.

Now the government is out there saying, `Rounding up can't go above 10 per cent,' almost as if it were a virtue. During the election campaign, before this was legislated, how much did the government tell us that prices would go up? They said that prices would go up by only 1.9 per cent.

Witness the tampon issue—a clear and blatant breach. The inflation impact would be small and one-off, it was said, and interest rates would not go up as a consequence. They said there would be no taxes on taxes, yet we are seeing a triple tax on petrol and there will be double taxation imposed on a whole range of state and local government services.

We cannot tell you how we will lift the burden until we know how much money is available and who it is going to hit.

Most of them were part of arrangements in previous regimes when they were in government and they actually proposed a GST. I might add that there was no talk of income tax cuts associated with it. There was certainly no compensation for pensioners. Their performance under Labor would lead everybody to the view that any changes Labor choose to make should the country be unfortunate enough to be left with a Labor government following a future election would all be bad news for pensioners and bad news for business. They would make the tax system inherently unfair, particularly for the disadvantaged in our community and particularly for rural and regional Australia. Surely even the shadow Treasurer must have been choking when he spoke about fuel pricing issues. This, after all, was the party that, while in government, increased fuel excise something like fivefold without any compensation. They thought nothing of massively increasing fuel excise every budget, having little regard for its impact on rural and regional Australia. Now we are asked to believe that they suddenly care about the impact of taxation on country people. Indeed, it has all been empty rhetoric of the classic Labor kind.  ']\n",
      "[\"The reality is that Labor have no plans whatsoever about how to reform the tax system, and the shadow Treasurer's comments made that abundantly clear today. He said, `Yes, we are going to wind it back. Even though we know it can't be wound back, even though it can't be fixed, we're going to wind it back. We don't know yet how we're going to wind it back.' We have only been talking about this for six or seven years, but they have not yet had any time to figure out how they are going to wind it back. They have not had any experience with it working. I suspect that they have actually been asleep. They have not watched 150 other countries of the world that have managed to have a GST. They have their eyes so firmly fixed on Botswana and Swaziland and their progressive wholesale sales tax systems that they have not been able to even think as they look around other countries of the world about what improvements might be able to be made in Australia. They are so committed to the Botswana and Swaziland systems that they have no idea whatsoever how they are going to improve the GST to make it acceptable in their sight.\"]\n",
      "[\"I was quite interested in the reference to and the crocodile tears about the 10 per cent GST on hotel bills. We, of course, saw a very embarrassed opposition when, in the answer, the obvious point was made that the first thing that is going to happen is that Labor's bed tax is going. Labor's precious, beloved bed tax, like their precious, beloved wholesales sales tax, is going to go. The Treasurer was absolutely right to make the point that, whenever Australians travel overseas, they pay GST on their travel bills. Of course, that is unless they go to Botswana and Swaziland. They must have the most booming tourist industries in the world because they have no GST on their hotels—people flocking around to get on Botswana airlines to rush across so that they can stay in GST-free hotels. I suspect that even the shadow foreign minister, who is noted for travelling to many of the exclusive venues of the world, has not been to Botswana and Swaziland. If he has I would be very interested to see his GST-free hotel bills, because I am sure that is the really telling point in encouraging people to travel around the world. \"]\n",
      "[\"The clear message coming from Labor's presentation today is that, whilst they are very happy to try to scare people who are perhaps uncertain about what the future may bring, whilst they are happy to play on the fears of and, indeed, endeavour to create fears in the minds of pensioners and the disadvantaged—those who perhaps are anxious about whatever the future may hold—they have no answers. They have no ways in which to resolve the issues that they seem to think are going to end civilisation as we know it. I often make the point that something like 150 other countries of the world have managed to make the conversion to a GST quite successfully. Australia is amongst the leading and best educated countries in the world. I find it hard to believe that the Eastern bloc countries and many of the Third World nations have managed to make the transfer to GST with so little pain, so little suffering, and yet, in Australia, the Labor Party try to tell us that it is going to end civilisation as we know it.\"]\n",
      "[\"I know the Labor Party are there to criticise. I know they feel a little bit irrelevant—suffering relevance deprivation syndrome—especially when it comes to tax issues because they have never had any tax policy to speak of. But the reality is that they do not fill the vacuum in their own minds by just empty words without any real solutions. I am looking forward to these miraculous cures that Labor are going to have to resolve all of the issues that they have raised over the years in relation to the GST. They will probably get up and say, `We really don't like this tax—this is really terrible—but we want the money and so do our state Labor colleagues. So we are going to keep the money but we are going to fiddle here on the edges and probably put some other taxes up along the line,' so that they can continue to collect the money with some little bit of window-dressing around the edges. \"]\n",
      "[\"If I were in a rural and regional area, as my electorate is, I would say that would be the part of Australia that would have most to fear from Labor's unmentioned changes to the tax system. Every previous time that Labor have needed to raise some money, the first thing they have looked at has been increasing fuel taxes, putting the price up—`It doesn't matter, they're out in the country'—and they do not seem to care as Labor divide country from city. The reality is that the coalition government is delivering to the Australian people not a new tax but a new tax system. There will be a radical change in the way in which taxes are collected in this country. People will get to keep more of their income, more of what they earn, because income tax rates will go down—although some things will be more expensive to buy—and in that way people will have more discretion over the way in which they spend the money they have earned, more control over the use of their own money.\"]\n",
      "['I think these measures will be warmly welcomed on 1 July 2000, when people start to get significant income tax cuts in their pockets, families with young children start to get increased benefits and pensioners get a real increase, not just compensation for the GST with more discretionary spending. These benefits to families will not be insignificant. A one-income family on $30,000 a year with two children, one aged under five, will get a tax cut of $71.32 per week. That is a very significant tax cut on an income of $30,000, and that is going to be real additional discretionary expenditure.']\n",
      "['What has become clear is that much of the opposition scaremongering about price increases is just that. No lesser an authority than Choice magazine has published a list in their January-February 2000 edition of what you can expect to happen to your weekly shopping bill after the introduction of a GST. Is it going to go up by 10 per cent? Is it going to go up by nine per cent or even by eight, seven, six or five per cent? In fact, it is going to go down. The average price for items will result in a basket cost of $3.12 less a week. So all of the scaremongering about 10 per cent being on this and all those sorts of other percentages all over the place are simply not demonstrated by the facts. If you have gone to countries around the world other than Botswana and Swaziland, you will have seen the experience of the introduction of a GST, and there was not a 10 per cent across-the-board price rise in any of those countries.']\n",
      "[\"So what are Labor going to do about it? How are they going to finetune it? Are they going to take away this $3.12 saving on their food and shopping bills that people will get under the GST arrangements? Do they have some other way—to use the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—of finetuning the system `to make it fair'? The reality is they have no plan. Their only idea is the WST and to suggest that the wholesale sales tax is fair, simple and easy to administer. Their suggestion that businesses are horrified about the prospects of introducing the GST is simply not supported by the Morgan and Banks survey that was published yesterday in the Courier-Mail. `Bring on the change, say the firms'—in a newspaper not exactly noted for lauding the activities of the coalition. In my electorate I was interested to read in the Biggenden Weekly, the most prestigious newspaper in Biggenden, an article about the Biggenden Thrifty T store, which has gone modern and updated its cash register and scales in readiness for the GST. The couple who are running that store, Barb Sharps and Elaine Cross, say they are looking forward to the introduction of the GST. They see many advantages for their business with the upgrades they have installed as they will not have to price mark any goods when those goods come into the store. So they have updated their system and they—and this is a small country store in a little town—are looking forward to the introduction of the GST and to taking advantage of the opportunities that the government is providing to upgrade their accounting systems in their store to make life easier for them.\"]\n",
      "['There are many advantages associated with this package and it will be essential, over the next month, that there be an effective education campaign so that people are aware of how the new system will work and how they can take advantage of its benefits. In my portfolio area a lot of information is being produced to particularly assist farmers to adjust to the new tax system. Farmers will be major beneficiaries under the new arrangement. About a billion dollars worth of farm costs are expected to go as a result of the tax changes. Their exports will be more competitive because there will not be embedded wholesale sales tax in what they are doing. Their fuel will be cheaper, particularly the transport fuel. One of the great things about the new tax system is the way in which we are moving to remove some of the disadvantage associated with living far away by lowering the costs of fuel, of freight and of bringing items to the port. It is estimated that the grain industry alone will save $30 million as a result of the lifting of the excise on rail freight. Those are big ticket, significant items that are good for our country. So we will have a new tax system that is not only good for individual Australians, families, pensioners and business but, most importantly, good for our country, and that will help bring our present tax system into the 21st century. Taxpayers will benefit from greater take-home pay and more discretionary expenditure and our country will benefit because of the encouragement that will provide to industry to invest and to expand and to build a better future for the taxpayers and their families.

Well might they hang their heads forlornly while listening to his defence of this debacle that is a GST. They can bury their heads in the sand, now that they have finally withdrawn them from the sand. Either way, this government is blind to the reality that the GST is overall an insidious tax that this government, a government in terminal decline, lacks the wherewithal to implement. Not only does the electorate recognise this but as poll trends showthe government is watching them daily as its fortunes plummetthe electorate condemns the government for continually underestimating the price effects of the GST.']\n",
      "[\"Let us examine in greater detail why this government is in terminal decline over this rotten, heinous tax. Let us first look at the confusion generated by Minister Hockey recently on the rounding-up issue. To continue with the anatomical analogies I opened with, he stuck both feet in his mouth on 14 January this year when he claimed that the price of petrol would fall under the GST when the PM and Treasurer had already been around the nation attempting to explain that the price of petrol need not rise under the GST. This simply expands the widening gap between urban and rural Australia. Minister Hockey's hands remain muddied and sullied because he refused to release the formula by which petrol prices need not rise—let alone that by which they might fall—as he thumped his barrel chest and announced they would. Mind you, under that barrel chest there beats a heart as hard as a railway seat. It is a characteristic of those opposite: hard hearts and soft heads.\"]\n",
      "[\"The confusion for motorists and the deceit which I have just outlined continue beyond the issue of petrol prices because, as we well know on this side, the GST package released back in August 1998 stated that the price of cars would fall by 8.3 per cent—a clear and unequivocal undertaking. Yet on 7 February the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin—speaking of hard hearts and hearts as hard as railway seats—told a Senate estimates inquiry that car prices may not fall at all. Indeed, 14 January may have been black Friday for the member for North Sydney, Junior Joe, because on that day he went even further and admitted that the ACCC, the price watchdog, had advised that firms could round up prices to the nearest dollar as a result of the GST. After initially exhorting that prices will not rise by 10 per cent, the minister conceded, with both bowed head and furrowed brow, that prices could stealthily rise by more than 10 per cent. So, contrary to the government's rhetoric that the ACCC would ensure that prices do not increase by more than 10 per cent, it now appears that it has given its imprimatur to this. It is really a pity for the world's strongest and oldest social democratic party that these admissions were not made during the last election campaign, because I have no doubt where we would be sitting right now. \"]\n",
      "[\"As we all know, the government said that the GST would raise prices by only 1.9 per cent. Now it is saying that rounding up means they cannot go above 10 per cent. In another example—one close to the stomachs of many on our side—Treasury officials told the Senate last week that beer sold over the bar will cost seven per cent more because of the GST, which is, typically, contrary to the statement of the Prime Minister on 23 September 1998 that claimed that ordinary beer prices would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent over the bar. If rounding up is supposed to be capped at 10 per cent, the impact of a GST is going to be significantly more than 1.9 per cent. This confusion means that it is essential that the detail of the GST, what people are paying, be fully disclosed on receipts. The government's argument that this is too hard is nonsense; it is just another attempt by this government to keep people in the dark and deny them their right to know. The only way that consumers can act on the ACCC's call to monitor and police GST rip-offs is if a breakdown of the price appears on cash register receipts.\"]\n",

The undertaker then told her that if she died before 1 July she would get her 10 per cent back. It is not much good getting your money back if you are dead, although I reckon that a few of those opposite have long since carked it but are still getting paid.']\n",

I cite the equally lucid example of the fact that it said the GST will not apply to stamp duty, but of course it does apply to the base premium. The government has not demanded that the states not apply the stamp duty after the GST has applied. So, for consumers, it does not matter whether the GST is applied on or before the stamp duty. The punters are still slugged twice and, contrary to the government's promises, this is still a tax on a tax. This is despite the fact that the government—and I reiterate this—promised that there would be no doubling up on tax. The government should end the confusion and tell the states that they cannot levy stamp duty, which should stand alone and be treated as such.\"]\n",

They want to know that this is a simple tax and not indeed a complex nightmare. The government clearly is lacking in a coherent strategy.

The CSIRO and the University of Queensland have entered into a joint venture agreement for the $110 million project, with the CSIRO contributing $50 million to this development. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction of the building is expected to be completed in 2002. The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. ']\n",

The range and strength of views put forward by the local community groups and residents can be understood when the size and nature of the proposed research facility are considered. The proposed complex will comprise three eight-storey wings and a multilevel car park. Local residents did have concerns about site selection, the visual appearance of the building, overshadowing and lack of privacy. They also expressed concern about additional noise during construction. The committee found that the proponents had considered many of the issues that residents have raised.  ']\n",

It is neither practical nor efficient to insist that the facility be located at another University of Queensland campus or site.

The committee was advised that the proposed design provides advantages in terms of natural light and internal flexibility. A different design, for example a single five-storey building, would have a larger building footprint, which brings its own problems. The committee accepts that the architect has attempted to ameliorate impressions of size and bulk through techniques such as underground levels, stepping the walls and landscaping. Tests have indicated that overshadowing will be minimal. The committee believes issues of privacy should be dealt with by the community liaison committee, which was actually formed at the suggestion of the committee. ']\n",

The first of these was the reliance on a disputed Brisbane City Council planning exemption on the basis of a special zoning to avoid council approval processes. The committee understands that the plans have, since the hearings, been submitted and approved by the Brisbane City Council, even though there is no statutory requirement for this at the present time.  The second was the belated establishment of the community liaison committee. As I said, this was a suggestion of the committee at the hearing. ']\n",

It is envisaged that this liaison committee will be able to resolve issues in an open and fair manner and to reduce the frustration and alarm that many residents have experienced with this project so far.

Education spending under this government has gone down by 6.8 per cent since 1996 and that indicates, accordingly, that there has been a huge increase in health and social welfare expenditure.

In 1995, 500,000 Australians were on the disability support pension, a passive program. In 1999, under this government, there are 577,000, an increase of 15 per cent. This explains the increase in social security outlays under this government.']\n",
      "[\"What we have seen is a huge shift from active investments in people, like education programs, to passive programs: social security, disability support pensions and welfare dependency. This goes against every international trend. We should be increasing the active investments in people, particularly in education and training, and reducing the outlays on passive programs. But this government has gone in the opposite direction. Some people might say, `This is an unusual Labor Party point to make—that this government has massively increased social welfare spending.' Well, it is not because the political point is this: no-one, whether they are left wing, right wing or in between, wants to see social security spending increase but fail to get results. Everyone in the political system and the electorate wants results. They want an end to welfare dependency; they want active investments in people; they want social mobility; they want an end to concentrated poverty in public housing estates. So this government stands condemned. If you are from the right-wing perspective and you do not like welfare spending, damn it for that—it is up. If you are from the left-wing perspective, and you want answers here and a fairer society, damn it for that as well—it is not getting results. That is the political point to make in this debate.\"]\n",
      "['Finally, I come to the point I was alluding to before question time, especially with regard to remarks made by the member for Wannon. Monetary policy is a crude nationwide policy tool. It can in no way be spatially sensitive. It cannot make a distinction between economic conditions in the bush and economic conditions in the city. There is one cash rate set by the Reserve Bank, and it applies nationwide. That is all the more reason for fiscal responsibility, all the more reason to keep interest rates down and all the more reason to improve national savings and ease the pressure on the Reserve Bank. But also, that is all the more reason for spatial policies—what I referred to earlier as spatial economic policies. I am not known as too much of a Keynesian, but I will say this: there is a role for government in boosting outlays in depressed neighbourhoods. Economists sometimes call this demand switching, where you shift from private investments to public outlays and labour intensive work in the community sector. Let us have not only demand switching but also location switching. Let us move some of the government outlays and jobs out of employment rich locations and get them into the depressed neighbourhoods that need work. Work is the best form of social programming and social mobility.']\n",
      "[\"The other thing we need to do is to have a look at some of the incentives programs in the United States to move investment into depressed neighbourhoods. I recommend you read Bill Clinton's recent State of the Union address. You might also want to think, when people talk about a GST roll-back, of exempting neighbourhood shopping centres in depressed areas from paying the GST. This would be a magnificent initiative: equitable because of the poor people who live in those suburbs, and socially desirable because it would finally give middle-class shoppers a reason to shop in these depressed areas. The neighbourhood shop, burnt out and derelict, is often part of the social problem. It is a jobs and investment policy and also—the main thing about the GST—there is no definitional problem. You can define these neighbourhood areas and make them GST free. (Time expired) \"]\n",

I attended a memorial service for the National Servicemen's Association of Queensland in Caboolture last Sunday, 13 February, at the recently dedicated memorial there. It is strange to think of a city or a town of 100,000 people in this country not having a war memorial, but that was the case until 7 July last year when His Excellency Major-General Arnison AO officially opened the memorial in King Street, Caboolture.\"]\n",

They, along with me, believe that Australians should have a greater sense of service to their nation. There are many ways Australians can serve their country in times of peace and war, and a grateful nation acknowledges and recognises such service with suitable awards, usually medals. We all know that this government and the previous government have recognised with recognition certificates the efforts of our service personnel during World War II and those who participated through subsequent campaigns.\"]\n",
      "['We are all familiar with our war veterans, both men and women, marching on Anzac Day wearing a variety of medals which serve two purposes. The first sort of medal, such as the Australian Active Service Medal, the Pacific Star and so on, is to give public recognition to their active service in the various theatres of conflict. Other decorations, such as the military metal, and the most well known and most highly decorated, the Victoria Cross for bravery, have also been won by many fine Australians.']\n",

Australia has also recognised those who have served in peacetime such as civilian construction squadrons or corps, the Land Army, the police, the fire service and so on. But there are two groups who I consider deserve recognition but have been to date denied it by successive governments. I am requesting and calling on our own government, in particular the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to consider not only the nashos but those long-serving officers who look after the various cadet corps around Australia and to recognise the input these people have made to the wealth of this nation through their service.\"]\n",

Recognising these service personnel in an appropriate fashion will go a long way to their having a fitting place, in Anzac Day parades and throughout society. The National Servicemen's Association was formed basically to give a home to these men who, from 1951 to 1972, in the Navy, Army and Air Force, were conscripted to do compulsory military training. Many went on to fight in conflicts. In fact, 287,000 young men were conscripted for national service, and 187 of those were killed on active service. A further 1,479 were wounded in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam.\"]\n",

I believe that we as a nation deserve to give people like her that have long service within such organisations equal recognition, and also people like Rita Sheehy, who is the squadron leader of the Caboolture squadron within the Australian Air League.

      "[\"The second issue I would like to bring to the House's attention today was raised in question time by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He was referring to a Queensland bill—the Vegetation Management Bill. In this new role that I now fulfil as parliamentary secretary for small business, you would think this bill would be far removed from that portfolio; quite the contrary. Recently, when dealing with the dairy industry in my electorate, I stumbled upon this state law which has now passed the Queensland parliament. It has not yet received royal assent. I do not believe Mr Beattie will ever present it to the Governor until such time as he feels he can get money from the federal government to compensate people. This is a totally failed bill. The bill will affect dairy farms. I think everyone who hears this will understand and will be able to appreciate the situation. Imagine a dairy farm of 250-odd acres producing 1,000 litres of market milk a day. Their prime piece of real estate is their river flats where the grass grows greenest. Two hundred metres either side of that river will be locked up, fenced and treed; 100 metres either side of any creek will be locked up, fenced and treed; 50 metres either side of any dry gully or any waterway which carries water, even in times of flood, will be locked up, fenced and, once again, will not be useable for cattle.\"]\n",

It will also have a dramatic impact throughout south-east Queensland, whether to the east of the Great Divide at Crows Nest and those surrounding areas or in the areas of Boonah or Beaudesert. The Labor government in Queensland does not understand the impact this will have on not only the small businesses in the agricultural sector but also the small businesses in the town. These are farms that have been in the family for 90 years, for five generations, which are carrying substantial debt because the children have taken the farm and paid out the parents in order to upgrade the farm and bring it up to what is a modern standard today so that it can be economically sustainable. Many of them are not yet aware of the consequences of having the rug pulled out from under them if this bill is proclaimed.']\n",

Even if you were to compensate the landowners for their loss, the loss of that productive land would translate into the businesses in the towns. They would also be decimated, quite literally. It flows through to the transport providers, the veterinary surgeons and the stock and station agents. I do not believe that Mr Beattie or Mr Welford have given any consideration to the small businesses in south-east Queensland. We have seen the people of Winton demonstrating against the Beattie government, but it is not just the far-flung bush that we see on the news. People within an hour or two's drive from Brisbane will find their livelihood shattered. It simply is not good enough to put up a bill which means that land values in those areas are falling dramatically. People simply cannot sell their land. Prospective buyers know that they may not have a chance to even utilise the most pristine piece of real estate on the properties. What is the Queensland government saying? It is saying, `Fence it and have it treed. Continue to pay your rates, continue to pay your land taxes and continue to maintain the weeds. But don't have access to it.' This is land that these people have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for. I believe the bill as it has been proposed by the Beattie government is nothing short of criminal. I believe it will devastate small businesses in south-east Queensland because they rely on the success of the rural land-holders. \"]\n",

I am suggesting to you that you as a fellow Queenslander should be standing up to Palaszczuk and to Beattie and saying, `What are we going to do?' No-one is blaming the Premier for this. But he should be saying, `Do not stand idly by whilst a great industry in Queensland is torn apart because farmers are carrying somewhere in the vicinity of three-quarters of a million dollars worth of debt'—not because they are inefficient farmers but because they are the best farmers, because they are young, because they are vibrant and are picking up the latest technology and have invested in their farms.\"]\n",

They are held as security against loans that have been taken out, originally against QIDC, now against private banks. They paid $300 to $400 per litre.

It is important, particularly as the government approaches the mid-term of the current electoral cycle, to take some sort of policy stock of where the government now finds itself. ']\n",
      "[\"I propose in my remarks to the chamber to concentrate on a few things. The first is the government's record of fiscal and macro-economic achievement. The second is the government's contribution to what could broadly be described as national capacity building, in particular in the most critical area—education. The third is the government's policies for our future and continuing engagement in the global economy and the region of which we are part. All three of these are critical because they go to our future as a nation. In terms of the last of those three points, that is, our engagement globally and regionally, we go to the critical questions of globalisation, the autonomy of nation states—including this one, Australia—within the global economy, and whether our opportunity for independent policy manoeuvre is going to be increasingly circumscribed in the future. \"]\n",
      "[\"The first point I said I would address is the government's record of fiscal and macro-economic achievement. Daily in this place the government boasts of its self-proclaimed record of fiscal management. The actual record is the reverse—as a cold, hard review of statistical data reveals. I make this claim on a number of bases. First, whatever fiscal consolidation this government managed to achieve during its first couple of budgets during the term and a half that it has been in office has largely been offset by a parallel exercise in undeclared fiscal loosening in the last several budgets. This was most dramatically illustrated by the events of last year when, as a result of the unforeseen deployment of troops to Timor, the government had to resort to a one-off increase in the Medicare levy in order to fund that engagement. What had happened as a consequence of the government's fiscal management over several budgets was that, by the time we had got to the end of 1999 and needed some spare cash to fund the Timor deployment, we had absolutely zero fiscal latitude in which to move. On this point I would draw the attention of honourable members to an excellent table which was incorporated in the speech to this parliament yesterday by my friend and colleague the member for Kingston.  \"]\n",
      "[\"There is, however, a second factor which impacts on the government's fiscal policy achievements in the period to date and, in particular, on the government's fiscal standing in the period which lies ahead. Here I refer to the upcoming $17 billion tax bribe, for which we should read `revenue loss', to be paid for the introduction of the consumption tax, an event which all backbenchers opposite, particularly those in marginal seats, are eagerly awaiting on 1 July. This single act, the introduction of the consumption tax and the $17 billion income tax package associated with it, is probably the highest form of fiscal vandalism which has been inflicted upon the Commonwealth since the current government has been in office—all done at the hands of Botswana Pete. \"]\n",
      "[\"We have had with Botswana Pete a hard fiscal exterior but something very soft and gooey on the inside, once again, when you go to the core of the statistical data. The problem for us all is that for the triennium ahead, during which this $17 billion bribe will be shelled out, the fiscal condition of the Commonwealth will go from borderline to downright parlous. It not only reduces to less than zero the Commonwealth's capacity to repair the very considerable social policy damage it has already wrought in such critical areas as education over the last quadrennium; it is also based on the most optimistic and probably heroic assumptions about future levels of economic growth and consequential revenue growth. \"]\n",
      "['All of this, we know, is entirely hostage to the future shape of the international economy, this in turn being hostage to the US economy in particular and to the level of US interest rates. But the further and real danger which the nation faces is that at a time when the Reserve Bank has already raised interest rates by 0.5 per cent—considerably higher than parallel interest rate movements in other OECD economies—to dampen demand and the consequential inflationary pressures arising from that demand, what we have with Botswana Pete is an exercise of pumping out a further $17 billion worth of extra demand into an economy which the Reserve Bank of Australia has already admitted is overheating.']\n",
      "[\"This in turn leads to the question of the government's broader record of macro-economic management. We hear a lot from the government on this particular issue. It is the same sort of self-congratulatory language that we have come to be familiar with from the government in their hollow claims of fiscal consolidation. On this question, though, I would make a couple of simple points which we never hear in this chamber from the lips of Botswana Pete. One: what will the impact on inflation of this 10 per cent consumption tax be on prices when added to the $17 billion injection to national demand? \"]\n",
      "[\"Two: what will the GST do to wage pressures in this economy? In the Senate inquiries held on the GST last year, there was considerable evidence from a number of expert witnesses, including Professor Dixon, that none of us could be at all confident about the price impact of the GST, but we could be confident that it would be likely to give rise to considerable wage pressures right across the economy. Professor Dixon's conclusion at that time was that the government's projection of 1.9 per cent movement of the CPI was heroic because it failed to take into account anything by way of a realistic political assumption about the likely reaction in the union movement to the introduction of the GST.\"]\n",
      "['The evidence to date, as we move into the real period of implementation, is transparent for all. What we see, in Queensland for instance, is that rail workers are already negotiating an enterprise bargaining arrangement which includes improvement in wages over a two-year period of 7 per cent but with an additional GST clause. This is an opportunity for those party to the enterprise bargaining arrangement to go back and obtain  further GST related compensation if the CPI moves beyond that which the government has so far projected. We have seen parallel evidence emerge already in relation to an impending claim by the CPSU. Again in terms of the macro economy, the overall point is: what is this GST doing to wage pressures in the economy, and what will those wage pressures in turn do to the overall level of inflation? ']\n",
      "['Furthermore, how will these factors together impact on the already unacceptably high current account deficit that we have in this country, which is running somewhere in the vicinity of 5.5 to 6 per cent of GDP and bordering on the absolute threshold of an adverse reaction from global capital markets? This economy has sailed very close to the wind in the last couple of years in terms of the attitude of global capital markets to the level of the current account deficit. We have heard heroic rhetoric from those opposite about fireproofing the Australian economy from the impact of the Asian financial crisis, but what has in fact occurred is that total Australian exports have collapsed, imports have continued to surge and, as a consequence, we have enormous pressure on the current account. There is an absolute ceiling which cannot be crossed in how high that can go. When you add to the existing pressures in the economy the new factors which will emerge both pre and post 1 July—the consumption tax, the injection of the $17 billion into the economy, as well as wage pressures consequential on those two other factors—the pressure on the current account is going to become almost overwhelming.']\n",
      "['A further factor is when you aggregate all of the above—that is, $17 billion worth of extra demand, the prospect of significant wage driven inflation and excessive pressure on the CAD—what will we then have by way of a future interest rate regime in this country? What will the impact be on future levels of national economic growth? If rates are ratcheted up as a consequence of the movements which I have just described, the impact on growth will be demonstrably negative. Taking it down from the national level to individual holders of mortgages across suburban Australia and to the small business community who currently have loans, the damage that will be wrought will not just be esoteric damage to the national economy in a set of un-pretty figures but real living, human, physical damage out there in average working Australia.']\n",
      "[\"The second major issue I want to address in this appropriation debate is the government's record on what I describe as `simple national capacity building'. Government is not just about appropriate forms of fiscal management; it is not just about appropriate forms of macro-economic management—foundational as both those factors are; government is also about how we use the resources of the state to build human capital and economic infrastructure. It is about how we build the nation and not just about how we shrink the size of government, which seems to be the underlying philosophy of those opposite.\"]\n",
      "[\"The government's philosophical view is fairly clear cut. It is driven from an overall philosophy of neo-liberalism. It rests on the premise that government is bad, that the smaller government is the better it is, and that the ultimate and best form of government is some sort of `bonsai' government—diminutive, tiny, disappearing. They believe nations are built primarily by markets. When you strip it all back, the only legitimate function for government in that particular world view is probably in the following three areas: firstly, maintaining the physical security of the realm from external attack; secondly, maintaining domestic law and order at home, although I suppose in the ultimate neo-liberal world you could contract that out to MSS as well; and, finally, the policing of markets within the country. Beyond those three functions, that philosophical view actually holds that there is no further or additional legitimate function for the state.\"]\n",
      "[\"By contrast, we on this side of politics have a different view. Of course, we recognise the importance of markets but we are also equally driven by the fact that markets fail—that there is a measurable phenomenon out there in economics called `market failure'. For example, markets do not provide basic precepts or basic programs which deliver equality of opportunity. Markets often do not provide economic infrastructure in rural and regional areas. Markets do not provide safety nets, as is seen from the most recent and graphic illustrations which have been the subject of debate in this House both yesterday and today. \"]\n",
      "[\"When we turn to this government's record in what I have described as `national capacity building'—that is, building the future capacity of Australia to generate even more wealth for the national economy which could then be delivered to Australian families—what has actually occurred? I will focus briefly in the area of education. ABS data released last year demonstrates quite graphically what has occurred. In terms of total Commonwealth spending on education—this is ABS data, not mine, not the Labor Party's, not Uncle Tom Cobley's—between 1995-96 and 1998-99 in real terms we had a real dollar reduction of half a billion in terms of total government outlays in the education sector, a reduction from 1.99 per cent of GDP to 1.90 per cent of GDP.\"]\n",
      "['When you look at university funding, it becomes even more dramatic: a fall over that same period of some 12.7 per cent, from 0.94 per cent of GDP to 0.82 per cent of GDP. If you aggregate education, research and training, outlays in those areas when Labor left office represented something like 3 per cent of GDP. In 1999-2000, they represent 2.53 per cent of GDP. In fact, if the last Howard budget had sought to maintain effort comparable to that which was being maintained for the last Labor government budget, it would have had to have injected an extra $2.87 billion in education, research and training to achieve a comparable outcome. Added to all of the above are the changes which the government has made in terms of the R&D taxation regime. In the entire developed world—the entire OECD—any economy worth its salt or any government worth its salt, right around the world, is moving in the direction of investing as much of its government resources as possible in the development of human capital through education, training and research and scientific innovation. In this country, we have a government moving diametrically in the reverse direction. It is a government which has mastered the art of rhetoric rather than reality. The repeated statements which have been made in this chamber on the question of literacy in schools is a classic example. We have statement after statement about the importance of literacy programs in schools. When you strip it all back, the amount of additional resources actually delivered to schools through the states to achieve those outcomes is almost invisible.']\n",
      "['The final thing I said I would touch on in this speech is the relationship between how we manage our domestic economy, how we seek to develop programs to develop our national education and our national economic capacity and how that all interrelates with the global and regional economic environment in which we operate. The reality is that fiscal policy, macro-economic policy and social outlays are all shaped and to some extent controlled by our global economic circumstances. The truth is that we are radically impacted by world economic growth. We are radically impacted by world trade growth, in trade liberalisation or the reverse—protectionism. We are also radically impacted by the operation of global and regional currency and capital markets as demonstrated most graphically by the Asian financial crisis post 1997.']\n",
      "[\"I would like to say a couple of things about these matters. We have seen recently the implosion of the WTO process in Seattle. If we have a new outbreak of protectionism worldwide, it will spell doom and disaster for working people across the world, including in this country. My criticism of the government's record is: why was the machinery of APEC not more properly harnessed in the Auckland meeting which preceded the Seattle summit to actually achieve consensus among APEC nations going into the Seattle millennium round to ensure that that round kicked off in the first place? There was a failure of policy.\"]\n",
      "['On the Asian financial crisis, where did this government go—or did the government go missing—in using APEC to provide a coordinated regional response? Where have we gone in terms of the lessons which were delivered loud and clear on the volatility of regional and global currency markets and the destruction of the Indonesian economy virtually overnight? We are told it has gone from the IMF to the G7 to the G20. Where is it? What is the APEC position? There is supposed to be a Manila framework agreement. What is the government doing? Where are the priorities? APEC provides this nation with machinery to add value to national, regional and global responses to these critical issues. But it has not been used effectively to that end.

      "[\"It gives me great pleasure to support the appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4, bills related to the fourth Howard government's budget delivered in May of last year. In particular, these appropriation bills relate to spending of nearly $2.5 billion across a range of portfolio areas, including some important spending relating to Australia's overseas humanitarian response over the last nine months. Everyone will recall the Kosovo crisis and the East Timor crisis. As Australians, we are all very proud of the response that all Australians made and the financial contribution we committed through our government, both for our troops going across and acquitting us as well as they did in peacekeeping and setting up safe havens across Australia so we could give some support and chance of rehabilitation to refugees escaping from those terrible places of war. I want to acknowledge that, in the case of the Puckapunyal army base and another base near Wodonga, members of the Goulburn Valley Australian Albanian community spent many thousands of hours in support of their fellow countrymen from Albania and made it much more possible for them to get over the trauma of the war zone they had just left.\"]\n",
      "[\"I am very pleased to support the government's allocation of further moneys in these appropriation bills for the introduction of arrangements to deliver the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. These moneys will deliver major savings in rural and regional areas, particularly for diesel users, of course. Farmers and small business people in the electorate of Murray will be advantaged because we have an enormous transport industry that is involved in taking fruit, dairy products, grains and meats to export markets and to the domestic markets. As well, we have allocated in these appropriation bills some $35.15 million for the natural disasters relief arrangement and $23.1 million for the forest industry structural adjustment package.\"]\n",
      "['I would have thought that most decent Australians would have agreed with the Howard government in understanding why we are funding these special measures for non-metropolitan Australians. So I was surprised and disappointed to hear the member for Werriwa, just before question time, denigrating rural people as whingers, whiners and opportunists when it came to them expecting to have some sort of support from the Howard government, which has a majority of its members representing rural people. We had an extraordinary situation where a member of the opposition stood up and called people who live in rural and remote Australia whingers and whiners because they expect to have their life opportunities come close to that of people who live in metropolitan areas.']\n",
      "[\"I wonder if in fact it is because the member for Werriwa, having got up this morning, read Ross Gittins's article in the Age. Ross Gittins also criticised the Howard government for an emphasis on spending on regional infrastructure. Mr Gittins wrote that `we're in danger of flipping from cold-hearted to soft-headed' when it comes to taking on board the needs of rural Australians. He talks about `panic' in terms of policy making. So I have to wonder what is behind all of this. Ross Gittins and the member for Werriwa say the problem is that we are forgetting that there are also some poor in pockets of metropolitan Australia. I would have thought that the Howard government has already distinguished itself, incredibly so, in making the new tax system such that all Australians will be advantaged. The new tax system is there in particular to assist those on lower incomes, wherever they may find themselves—in Australian cities or in rural areas. For example, we will have a much fairer go when it comes to a lower income family seeking to do an extra part-time job or some overtime. Under existing tax laws, a lot of that extra income was swallowed up with tax before you even saw the colour of your money, and so there was a disincentive to make that extra effort for your family. It just was not worth it when it came to the tax take. \"]\n",
      "['Lower income families in particular will see their entitlements delivered more simply and more adequately. Pensioners and self-funded retirees are not forgotten, of course, with our new tax law. It is also the case that our government managed the economy in such a way that we survived the economic downturns in the Asian region, and we have lower unemployment rates now across all of Australia—in low income metropolitan areas and in low income rural areas—the lowest unemployment rates in living memory of Australians at this time. It is in the poorer suburbs of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane that there is now a chance to buy a home or a car or to go on a holiday. Indeed, it is a chance to have some savings for any purpose whatsoever. So, I do not think this government can do anything but stand tall when it comes to supporting lower income people in whichever region or part of Australia they are currently living. ']\n",
      "['But the member for Werriwa and Ross Gittins from the Melbourne Age are right: this government is paying very close attention to rural and remote communities. But is this close attention soft-headed or panic? Let me say that anyone who has any familiarity whatsoever with the socioeconomic data of Australia, and any measure of community service standards that are delivered to metropolitan or rural areas, would know that in fact you have an extraordinary story of the haves and have nots. For example, there are lower incomes in Braybrook or in some of the outer suburbs of any of our capital cities, that is for sure, but there are also bulk-billing clinics within 10 to 15 minutes for most of those lower income populations.']\n",
      "['I challenge the member for Werriwa and others like him on the opposition benches to find themselves access to a bulk-billing clinic for medial attention in the electorate of Murray, for example. Our doctors in Murray are so overworked and so few in number for the size of the population that there was a closure of their books to new patients some time ago. Certainly they have no incentive to, and indeed they do not, offer bulk-billing across that electorate. So people on lower incomes, while they pay their taxes, do not get back the sorts of Medicare rebates that other Australians enjoy.']\n",
      "['But let us look at some more simple statistics. Let us look at the life expectancy of rural people compared with their city counterparts. A male living in an Australian capital city can expect, on average, to live to almost 76 years of age while in a remote or regional centre of Australia the life expectancy is only 71 years. Is that because of genetics or is it because of a whole range of issues associated with access to health services, the time that it takes to get appropriate medical services in an emergency, the difficulty associated with the sort of lifestyle that is experienced in country areas or the difficulties of getting access to mental health services? Very often, the high level of rural youth suicides is associated with a sense of hopelessness and haplessness that, sadly, overtakes a lot of our young people who find themselves stranded in remote communities, far from work and with a sense of loss when it comes to comparing their lifestyle with what they see on TV each night.']\n",
      "['Let us look at the educational standards and compare metropolitan and rural Australia. Let us look at Victoria, in particular, with a brand new Labor government. The Victorian government spends $521 per head of population per annum on higher education institutions in the city, while the equivalent spent in regional areas in the same state is half of that, at $235 per head of population. This pattern is repeated across Australia again and again. It has been estimated that it would cost an extra $2 billion per year to bring per capita expenditure in regional Australia up to that of a metropolitan level.']\n",
      "['I think we all know in this House about the differential between retention rates of students who complete their education in country areas compared with those in metropolitan areas where there is easier access to a whole range of educational institutions. While some 70 per cent of students in urban areas complete year 12, the equivalent figure in rural areas is substantially less than that. If you compare urban areas with remote areas, those figures drop away to just over 50 per cent. It is a very sad thing that, while we all know it is more likely for a professional who has come from a rural area to return to a regional or remote community after graduation, fewer of those students are gaining entrance to universities to train as dentists, as general practitioners, as architects and as lawyers and so rural areas have even fewer possibilities of getting people who not only choose to come to regional areas but choose to stay. ']\n",
      "[\"To people on this side of the House, that sort of information is not new. Apparently it is a surprise to the member for Werriwa. He pointed out that not all rural and remote areas are poor and so it is inappropriate to have special measures. Let me say that on this side of the House we do not suggest for a minute that there is a single depressed standard of rural experience across Australia. My own electorate of Murray is perhaps typical of a lot of areas. In one half of the electorate—in the Goulburn and Murray valleys—we have boom times with fruit growing. We have just had one of the best harvests on record, and we have seen enormous private investment go ahead. But the other half of the electorate is a wool-wheat growing area in which there has not been income for some three years. Many hundreds of families are now in receipt of the federal government's exceptional circumstances payment. Young families have had to make a choice between having their child continue schooling until years 11 and 12 or to put fuel in their vehicles and to put in a crop. There is an extraordinary differential across rural Australia, just as there is in urban Australia—I acknowledge that—but the vast number of communities that are well beyond the tram tracks in Australia deserve similar life chances as those in urban areas.\"]\n",
      "['There is an absolute imperative to assist rural and remote communities not only because of issues of justice and equity and the rights of all Australians but because of the environmental imperatives that we are now facing in Australia. As we speak, there is raging dryland salinity across parts of our wheat country, especially in Western Australia and in parts of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. There is also an emerging problem in Queensland. We understand the nature of some of these environmental problems. One single farm enterprise cannot tackle issues like revegetating perhaps 20 per cent or 30 per cent of their property, given that that will mean loss of income for them and, if they have entered into agroforestry, perhaps 30 or 40 or 50 years before there is a return. We need to see a regional approach, with major across-catchment planning and strategies which will require cost sharing across those regions and a great deal of capacity building amongst the human communities to tackle the problems of soil nutrient depletion, water quality loss and the impact of vegetation loss that occurred, sometimes generations ago.']\n",

It is an absurdity to tell a farmer to become green when he is in the red. To quote a lot of my local people, it is very hard to pull your socks up if you have none. Land managers often do not have the means—they do not have the income and, often, do not have the energy—to do the extraordinary amount of land and soil rehabilitation required to sustain our biodiversity. These sorts of communities are so grateful to the Howard government for introducing the Natural Heritage Trust in 1996-97. We understood the imperatives for this country, and in particular that the needs of rural communities should be supported. We set up the largest environmental fund that has ever been made available in Australia. It is the result of the partial corporatisation of Telstra, which meant that, fortunately, we could retire a lot of Labor's debt, and we were also able to put $1.5 billion into the Natural Heritage Trust. \"]\n",
      "[\"More than 3,000 projects have since been funded through the trust. Across Australia we now have a sense of hope and a sense of partnership and cooperation in communities, whereas before there was a sense that there was no future for farming families other than to go to the city and to join the unemployed. We have just completed a mid-term review of the Natural Heritage Trust, which is now in the process of being put into the public arena. It has been very gratifying to work on that mid-term review as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment and Heritage and to see the sorts of responses we had from the participants who have come back to us and said, `It's these dollars that have made the difference.' They have expressed a real concern about how they can sustain that sort of investment should the trust fail to continue in years to come. \"]\n",

As I have said, there should have been no great surprise about the actions of those who protested in Seattle about what they saw as a process from which a large portion of the global community was shut out. I think that the criticism of the World Trade Organisation that it lacks transparency is a very fair criticism. I personally believe that the World Trade Organisation and the outcomes from the decision of the WTO have to take into account the effect on labour standards and their effect on the environment. If one looks at the way in which the World Trade Organisation has used those things that came out of its formation post Bretton Woods and the GATT process it is interesting that often it has made decisions, such as in the environmental field, which in fact go counter to the protection of the environment. These are issues in which, in a general sense, Australia needs to be a player.

Howe Leather's crime is that it actually, in supplying automotive leather in competition with American companies, was able to get, I believe, five per cent of the American market. In the way in which American companies can have great influence over what the American bureaucracy does, a couple of those leather manufacturers in America persuaded the United States administration that they should take action, and they did. They appealed through the processes of the WTO and were able to get an interim decision which indicated that the type of assistance that had been provided to Howe Leather by the Australian government—assistance that was there to help an Australian industry, just like other countries would help their own domestic firms to open up export markets—was outside what had been agreed to by the World Trade Organisation. \"]\n",

So it was up to the Howard government, in its first term, to try to put together a package that would be seen to be in agreement with WTO rulings and would assist Howe in its export drive into the United States. This all happened towards the end of December 1996 and I can remember being in this place imploring the then minister for industry, John Moore, to try to get a decision before Christmas. As it transpired, this decision occurred early in 1997. There was great confidence that the restructuring of the assistance to Howe was going to be well and truly within the guidelines of the WTO.

In further correspondence in June 1999, the member for Farrer, the then Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, indicated why the Australian government had decided not to take the matter to the WTO appellate body, the action open to them being to appeal the tribunal's decision.

These are areas where there is a great degree of continuing unemployment, so the loss of that number of jobs would have a devastating effect. Not only has this decision caused concern here in Australia and to Howe Leather in particular but it has sent shivers up a number of people's spines throughout the global community. Now even the United States administration knows that they might have taken this a bit too far. At the moment an action is being taken in the WTO over grants that the Americans have given to a number of big firms—this is mentioned in today's Bulletin article—as tax subsidies under the foreign sales corporations provisions may have violated trade rules. Washington now, bless its soul, is concerned that the type of precedent that has been set in the Howe Leather case might really see it done between the eyes because, as I understand it, the assistance that the American administration has been giving to a number of big firms—including the likes of Boeing, Microsoft and Motorola—is in the order of $3.5 billion annually.

The reaction of the present Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, to this was a great deal of concern and worry that we had been put in a no-win position, that we really did have to look at the way in which we could get ourselves out of the mess. But I have to remind the House that part of the problem was that Australia decided not to go to the appeals body in the first place; then, as part of the way in which the United States appeal was dealt with, Australia agreed that it would not appeal the final decision. That is part of the summary of the events from the WTO's official writings on this matter. Now there is the problem that we have said that we are not going to use WTO procedures any further, and the minister is only left with the avenue of sending officials across to try to do an out-of-court settlement with the Americans. I hope that he can come to some accommodation because the ramifications to Australia are quite severe. If we do not put into place the decision of the WTO in the Howe Leather case, sanctions will be placed on other Australian businesses. Of course, the sanction that is talked about is something like 100 per cent punitive tariffs on exports that have no connection to automotive leather.

They take it very seriously. The importance of this is that it is not some form of industry welfare but a form of ensuring that an Australian company is able to compete in export markets on an equal footing with competitors—able to compete, not seeking to get any greater assistance than either other sectors in our domestic market that are trying to export or those that it is competing against.']\n",

I will specifically focus on some areas which are of interest in my electorate, such as the car industry, and on the cash economy, and also reflect on what the experience has been in New Zealand. Today we had a question time which was dominated by questions on the intricacies of the GST. I think it is worth asking all members what this debate is really about because, when you look at it, after the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, FID, stamp duty, excise and other things like, for example, the Sydney bed tax, what the new tax system involves is an extra $5 billion to $6 billion in indirect taxes. That is together with $12 billion in income tax cuts, most of it going to people on incomes below $50,000, which is 80 per cent of taxpayers, and also an extra $6.6 billion in social security payments, including the family package, pensioner and self-funded retiree rebate and pensions and benefits. To put it another way, by removing the wholesale sales tax, FID and stamp duty and by reducing excise on diesel, all of those things are equivalent to eight per cent of the GST. So what we have been arguing about today, and what I imagine will dominate a lot of the parliament for this year and a lot of the political debate, is an eight per cent GST with all the inefficiencies that you get with the wholesale sales tax and the business costs, the cost to exporters and so on, compared with a 10 per cent GST with benefits to exporters, incentives for people to save, incentives to export and invest and also with the chance to crack down on the cash economy—combined with $12 billion in income tax cuts and over $6 billion extra in government transfer payments.

Fifty-eight per cent of the wholesale sales tax falls on business inputs and 78 per cent of the FID falls on business inputs.

The Melbourne Institute, whose quarterly survey I have drawn on for some of this, expect the CPI to rise by less than two per cent. The Reserve Bank governor has said that they will look through that price rise in the setting of monetary policy. It is in effect a one-off lift in prices.

      "['When you look at the price of individual goods, and we learnt a lot about the price of Paddington bears and pyjamas and so on, you will see the final price will depend on several factors. If you consider items in a supermarket, it is hard to think of items that will be more expensive. In fact, most items will be cheaper. Broadly, GST-free items now should fall in price due to the removal of current indirect taxes. They are unlikely to rise in price. If we think of other things outside the supermarket, motor vehicles, for example, with a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax should fall in price. The Melbourne Institute estimates that gas will go up by only one to three per cent. Services and cafes are areas that will rise a bit higher than that. ']\n",
      "[\"An article in the January-February 2000 edition of Choice looked at a basket of goods at a supermarket and took the average price for each item, subtracted the sales tax and added the GST. It found that overall the basket cost $3.12 less. To give you an idea of how it works, most food which is currently sales tax free is going to be GST free, so those things will not change in price and maybe will fall in price due to embedded wholesale sales tax from transport and so on. Foods currently subject to sales tax, such as fruit juice and milk flavouring powders, as the sales tax is higher than the GST, should drop in price. There is food which is currently subject to the sales tax which is higher than the GST, and those things should drop as well. They include things like confectionery, muesli bars, chips, crisps, salted nuts, biscuits, cookies, crackers, ice-cream, frozen yoghurt, soft drink and pet food. Last of all is the category that will rise in price, and they include things like prepared food, doughnuts, pies and pasties and so on. They are a fairly small item in the supermarket. Also, things like toiletries and household cleaners are currently taxed at 22 per cent, so they should become cheaper. There is a report in the Herald Sun which confirms that beauty products and toiletries will be cheaper: `Cosmetic industry leaders promised that shoppers will enjoy lower prices when the GST replaces wholesale sales tax.' According to Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Australia executive director John Woods, `It is a competitive industry and savings will be passed on to customers.' Most of those products attract a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. They think cosmetic prices will fall by eight per cent with the switch to a new tax system. Price falls on popular toiletries such as shampoos and deodorants should be about five per cent. So, if you think about a supermarket, as you go down aisle by aisle, most of the items will show very little change in price. I ask the Labor Party to think of things that are going to rise significantly in price. Already supermarkets are saying that they expect that the baskets of goods will actually be cheaper.\"]\n",

For the last three years you have not been able to open a paper without a different story about Y2K. There have been all sorts of angles.

Of the 20 industries surveyed, the media was the industry least confident of being prepared, at 82 per cent.

They also had a wholesale sales tax with differing rates from 10 per cent to 60 per cent and 60 per cent of goods and all services were not included. So they had a very heavy reliance on income tax. That was creating a disincentive for people to work more, to get pay rises, to do study, to get promotions and so on because of the very high marginal rates of tax which fell on low levels. ']\n",

Interestingly, in the 1993 election, which saw Prime Minister Chretien come to power, he promised to replace the GST after an inquiry if he was able to find an alternative and better source of revenue. The inquiry did not reveal an alternative source of revenue. It still has the GST. It is now widely accepted in Canada. It is seen as quite fair and, in fact, it is looking at some of its exemptions: for example, if you buy six doughnuts they are GST free but one donut is subject to GST. Germany already has VAT.

Most countries in Europe did not do this. Even New Zealand did not do this. In New Zealand, they found that the cash economy was exposed by the GST and was actually much greater than they expected. The model that we have now with that integration of income tax and GST returns is even more likely than New Zealand to capture the cash economy.\"]\n",

The consequences of this, in evidence to the Productivity Commission, were that vehicles were less affordable.

In 1998 I had a great deal of difficulty with Glendenning post office, and that was basically because I had had a mail-out to my electorate which should have, under the contract we have with Australia Post, taken four days to deliver. In fact, it took 10 days to deliver. I raised my difficulties with Australia Post and had even taken the matter up with Mr Taylor from the New South Wales head office, who reassured me that no dispute existed at Glendenning, notwithstanding that instead of taking four days it took 10 days. Part of the problem was that my mail was being black-banned by the Postal Delivery Officers Union members, seven of whom worked at Glendenning post office. You and other members of the public may not recall this, but this was Mr John Howard's personal union in Australia Post. This is the one for which he used his electoral allowance to assist in a campaign. This is the one that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business always praises.\"]\n",

I do not want to in any way reflect on a former Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker—I am sure you would understand that—but I think it would be fair to say that the reason why my matter was not progressed to the Privileges Committee was that, whilst I had been singled out, there were some other lesser mailings that were also experiencing similar difficulty to me.']\n",

I guess there have been some ongoing problems there for some time, but basically the night shift supervisor blew the whistle on management, who had allegedly ordered them to claim two hours of overtime preshift over quite a considerable period of time—some 18 months. I would like to go over that again. The night shift supervisor objects to a management direction, that is, fraudulently claiming overtime. ']\n",

I know that you have even gone as far as presenting a private member's bill, which we have been unable to debate in this House. I made an adjournment speech back in 1997 about a small company called Corval, in Kurrajong Avenue, St Marys, that went belly up. I understand one of the Prime Minister's criteria is that it is an area blighted by high employment and dramatically affected by restructuring that has taken place. This was a textile company, but over and above those criteria the reason why this company suddenly went belly up was that the directors had failed to pay $100,000 of PAYE tax. Normally we are talking about the entitlements of workers, but in this instance the workers' PAYE tax was taken out by the company and the company failed to pass it on to the Australian Taxation Office. Then the Taxation Office wrote to the directors and said, `Notwithstanding your incorporation as a proprietary limited company, if you do not remit the money within 14 days, you as directors will be personally liable.' That is what instigated the bankruptcy of the company. \"]\n",
      "[\"I actually think it should be a criminal matter when companies fail to remit PAYE taxation. I do not condone directors holding onto workers' PAYE money and using it in the business. Not only had they done that but also they had used all the workers' entitlements. It was not a big company. I wish I had a textile company of 300 people. The constituent who brought the matter to me, Terri Coble, who is a friend, was very proud of the fact that she worked there. She had seen the ups and downs of the industry, and when they had to go onto 3½ days the workers were always happy to accommodate a shorter working week to keep the company going. But at the end of the day, when that company went belly up, that company where she had worked for 30 years, where the majority of women who were employed had worked for 20 years, those workers got not one dollar of their entitlements. There has been no prosecution of the directors: not only was the Taxation Office unhappy that the company failed to remit that money but the directors were never charged with that offence. That was the catalyst for the company finally going belly up. Of course, no director has been charged with misusing these workers' entitlements.\"]\n",

But, unlike National Textiles, in this instance it was the structural changes occurring within the textile industry that caused the difficulties. However, the workers have not received anything. It is unlike National Textiles in two instances: one is that Stan Howard is not the chairman of the board and, secondly, it was the Taxation Office writing to the directors about the PAYE taxpayers that was the catalyst for the bankruptcy of that company.']\n",

It was a pity that the company had not tried to take remedial action 12 months earlier. I am not sure that the workers would then have got 100 per cent of their entitlements, but I am convinced that the workers would have got some of their entitlements. Surely, in the circumstances that I have outlined, the minister at the table ought to take this case to the Prime Minister. It meets his criteria. They may be just battling women from my electorate, all with families, who are not likely to get another job because of this closure, who have never really earned fancy wages, but that 20 years of entitlements means a lot to them.

At the Whalan campus we have our first intake of year 11 into what will be the senior campus of the college. I was looking back at my maiden speech, and I referred to the issue of senior high schools then. Over the period that I have been a member, I have raised the issue of senior high schools on 39 occasions in one way or another in this House.

In particular, I think back to the budgets delivered during Labor's 13 years in office. Unfortunately, I remember them well—although, like most Australians, I certainly do not remember them fondly. It is understandable that Labor wants to forget those years. They think that in time people will forget the successive years of false dawns and empty promises. We know that when Labor was promising, during the 1996 election campaign, that the budget would remain in surplus, they were actually hiding a $10 billion budget black hole. No matter how hard Labor tries to cover it up, the Australian people will remember what really happened. They will not forget the fact that the opposition leader was finance minister at the time.\"]\n",
      "['In essence, this appropriation bill forms part of the 1999-2000 budget; a budget that delivers a $5.4 billion surplus; a budget that continues on the responsible path of the previous Howard government budgets of paying back the debt that Labor left behind. In fact, with this budget, the Commonwealth is on track to halve the net debt to GDP ratio it inherited. We will repay $20.5 billion in 1999-2000 alone.']\n",
      "[\"But what is important about this budget, as with our others, is that it is part of a real long-term economic plan for Australia's future—a plan that includes: the biggest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history, comprehensive taxation reform to create a simpler, fairer system where everyone pays their fair share, business taxation reform to restore incentive and create jobs, and workplace relations reform to make Australia more competitive and deliver a better standard of living for all Australians. We have a long-term economic strategy that is paying real dividends. In pure economic terms alone, we are doing remarkably well. Australia now has a 4.1 per cent annual growth rate, with a 0.2 per cent increase in the June quarter; our ninth consecutive quarter over four per cent. And that growth has consistently exceeded our budget expectations. That is, we have more than delivered what was promised with each budget. Again, this contrasts with Labor's approach in office. They continually promised better times and they failed to meet their own forecasts time and time again. I know it does seem difficult to comprehend, given that the last four budgets have all more than met forecasts, but Labor's record in office meant that their budget forecasts virtually were not worth the paper they were written on. Their budgets simply never delivered. All Labor delivered was false hope. If members opposite want to argue that this was not the case, I would welcome them doing so. It would mean that they were admitting that Labor deliberately set out in their last five budgets to run up deficits totalling more than $70 billion—$70 billion in five years. If the opposition cannot recognise that as economic mismanagement, if they cannot admit that there is a problem with racking up a massive $70 billion in deficits in just five years, then heaven help Australia if they ever get back into office. \"]\n",
      "[\"The fact is, each successive Labor budget was more about buying favour and band-aid solutionsand big dollars splashed around in election years. They were not about the national interest. They were not about Australia's future. The coalition's approach has been vastly different. And because our approach has always been about doing what is right for our country, we have been able to deliver practical benefits for mainstream Australiaimportant things like the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance to encourage and reward local residents who choose to take out this cover; commonsense things like more work for the dole places to benefit local communities and provide hope, experience and opportunity for young job seekers; and practical things like the record number of apprenticeships to provide genuine skills and real jobs to hundreds of thousands of young Australians. In fact, if there is a term that accurately describes the focus of the Howard government, it is `practical and commonsense'. For example, I refer to the decision to boost school literacy programs by an extra $131 million to help Australian children learn how to read and writea problem that was ignored by Labor for too many years. And the fact is that if you get the economy right, it opens up so many other opportunities. Instead of having to spend $9 billion a year just to pay off the interest bill on Labor's debt, we can spend this money on practical measuresbetter roads, better hospitals, an even stronger education system. We can also allow for unexpected funding measures, such as those contained in these two appropriation bills. \"]\n",
      "[\"These bills provide appropriation for some very worthy and important measures. For example, Appropriation Bill No. 3 provides $40.4 million to the Australian Federal Police for their participation in the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.

Both are important decision in terms of the remarkable role that Australia continues to have in restoring peace and ensuring democracy for the people of East Timor. I would like to take this opportunity to again convey our thoughts and prayers to the many Australian men and women who continue to do such an important, and at times very dangerous, job in East Timor. While the media is not so intently focused on their work as was the case last September when they first went to East Timor, they can be assured that we are thinking of them and we will not forget their service. Australians recognise that restoring political stability in our region is important. But we are also acutely aware that our service men and women are the ones who bear the brunt of any decision to engage in a hostile situation. Fortunately, our worst fears have not been realised. We recognise that this is due, in large part, to the professionalism of our troops led by Major General Cosgrove.\"]\n",
      "['Having a stable economy and a budget in surplus means we are in a much better position to take a leadership role in our region.

Appropriation Bill No. 3 also allocates $135.6 million to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to provide for our decision to offer safe haven to Kosovars and also East Timorese. Australia does have an international obligation, as a relatively wealthy nation, to take on a humanitarian role when it comes to situations of the magnitude we saw in both East Timor and in Kosovo. Operation Safe Haven meant that close to 4,000 refugees from Kosovo were welcomed to Australia from a very uncertain and dangerous situation. While playing a role in international humanitarian programs is very important, the overriding priority of the Howard Government is to extend the hand of support to Australians in need. Appropriation Bill No. 4 allows for an additional $35.15 million for anticipated claims under the natural disasters relief arrangement. ']\n",

Unfortunately, the nature of our vast and incredible continent means that dealing with natural disasters is an ongoing challenge. Communities throughout Australia have to grapple with differing circumstances throughout any given year. Our hearts go out to our fellow Australians when we see footage on our TV screens but, more importantly, we also offer real financial support. Part of the funds appropriated in this bill, for example, will allow for $1.5 million in ex-gratia payments to individuals whose homes were severely damaged when Cyclone Van swept through the Exmouth area in Western Australia last March.']\n",

Of course, there will always be one group of people who will find no joy in our improved circumstances. They will talk Australia down at every opportunity, just as they will rake through these two appropriation bills. During this debate they will carp and criticise as only they can. I am talking about the Australian Labor Party. This is the same party which had 13 years to bring about prosperity for mainstream Australians but delivered record high levels of unemployment, record high levels of debt and record high levels of business bankruptcy. They use the word `vision' a lot in many of their speeches. Treasurer Keating liked to call himself a visionary, but the fact was they never saw beyond the needs of their special interest groups. They never planned beyond doing whatever it took to win a few votes, even if it meant promising something they had no intention of delivering, like the infamous l-a-w law tax cuts. \"]\n",

This is a major national project with a long history.

If you want to get out of paying the GST on these things, there may be an option not to register, but then of course all of the GST on the inputs that are used by these organisations will not be refunded.

There is another claim in another document that was also put in the letterboxes of most Australians. This is a red booklet entitled The hidden tax system.

      "[\"On 9 December, I spoke in this place expressing concern about the government's recently released oil industry policy. The Downstream Petroleum Products Action Agenda was drawn up in-house with the industry. It proposes mergers and rationalisation amongst the oil majors. The government's decision to support mergers on a case by case basis contradicts the position of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that they are not in the public interest.\"]\n",
      "[\"The ACCC's public interest test requires that mergers encourage economic development and investment. The oil industry's objectives for the mergers are the opposite—to minimise the need for investment, particularly the investment required to produce clean fuels. Events since the government announced the policy change have indicated that my initial concerns were well-founded. During the course of the Christmas-New Year break, Mobil announced that BP and Shell had advised they would no longer take exchange product from Port Stanvac. As a result, Mobil was forced to cut its production there in half. The announcement indicated that 20 jobs had been lost.\"]\n",
      "[\"BP and Shell are now shipping refined product to Adelaide through their terminal facilities at Birkenhead. This is obviously a response to the government's new oil industry policy. Mobil's competitors want to position themselves for the expected merger process. The brutal reality is that, under the government's new policy, several Australian refineries are likely to close, and one of them could be Port Stanvac.\"]\n",
      "[\"What would be the implications of that for the local economy? The loss of the jobs of 300 employees and about 100 contractors. The refinery also supports the jobs of 1,200 others, and there would be a drop in the South Australian gross state product of one per cent. There would be a loss of $30 million to local households; $2.4 million in direct taxes; $59 million in value added; and some security of supply. It would be devastating to the economy in Adelaide's southern suburbs yet it is Howard government policy. Not only is it Howard government policy, but it is a policy constructed by the industry minister, who is a South Australian.\"]\n",
      "[\"Once again, the Liberal Party senators and members of the House of Representatives from South Australia are `missing in action' on an issue critical to our state. It will cost about $100 million to convert each Australian refinery to producing clean fuels. With margins severely reduced, the oil companies want to avoid that investment. The paradox is that, because Port Stanvac does not have a `cracker'—that is, it is not equipped to break down heavier feedstock into lighter fractions—the cost of converting it to clean fuels would only be about $40 million, but, if there are rationalisation alternatives, Stanvac's owners could seek to avoid even that investment. \"]\n",
      "[\"It has to be borne in mind that Exxon-Mobil have 12 refineries in the region. Australia's refining industry also has a problem of scale. The largest refinery in Australia is BP at Kwinana, which produces 139,000 barrels per stream day. Mobil at Port Stanvac produces 78 TBSD. Because of excess capacity resulting from the Asian economic crisis, they are competing with single refineries producing 250,000 barrels a day in Singapore and up to 800,000 barrels a day in Korea. It is a tough market, and the industry should have been subjected to a full, open and independent inquiry.\"]\n",
      "[\"The government has a responsibility to examine the sorts of policies that should be adopted to maximise investment in an internationally competitive refining industry in Australia. Instead, the government is actually encouraging mergers which will replace local refining capacity with dependence on imports. Port Stanvac has the largest lube oil refinery in Australia, with half its product being exported. It has other advantages, like being Australia's deepest port and it can take the largest supertankers. Because of its flexibility, the people who operate Stanvac have a vision for it as an excellent niche refiner. They deserve the best opportunity to make that a reality. The ACCC should subject all arguments by the government that the oil industry mergers are in the public interest to the most critical analysis.\"]\n",

Last week Israel launched a major air blitz over south Lebanon, wounding 18 civilians and causing serious damage to the country's power grid. Most of the country's power supply was cut. The people were plunged into darkness and mid-winter cold. Because the three main power stations feeding Beirut, the north and the Bekaa Valley were completely destroyed, there was power for only a few hours a day. One commentator described it as a blitz of pain. It is not the first time that power stations have been destroyed, but this does not make it any easier to bear for the people of Lebanon. They are caught up in someone else's battlefield. They are forced to suffer the consequences of an ongoing conflict which predates the birth of many of the country's inhabitants. They are truly victims of a tragedy. The search for peace between Israel and Syria is agonising for the Lebanese. They are trapped in the middle geographically and are therefore liable to be used by either side. It is difficult not to feel sympathy for the Lebanese. The southern part of their country is still occupied by the Israeli army, which is supposed to be withdrawing from south Lebanon by July this year. Also, there is the understanding—dating back to April 1996—whereby Israeli and Lebanese guerillas agreed not to attack civilian targets or launch assaults from civilian areas. This agreement has clearly been breached.\"]\n",

It must be given the opportunity to recover from the years of debilitating and constant conflict. For too long Lebanon has been the ham in the sandwich—the country in the middle; the country in which both Israel and Syria have fought a proxy war.

In my electorate of Stirling, the West Australian state Liberal government closed down the Scarborough Senior High School. This school had been operating for over 40 years and some famous Western Australians attended the school. These include the award winning author Tim Winton, award winning journalist Marnie McKinney, Test cricketer Mick Malone and the rock musician Mark Lizotte, also known as Diesel. The school had always been the focal point of the local Scarborough, Innaloo and Doubleview communities. Through the hard work of parents and members of the local community, money was raised to build a gymnasium and a 25-metre swimming pool for school and community use. These facilities are gone as less than two months ago, against the wishes of the local community, the Court Liberal government sent in the bulldozers and levelled all buildings on the site. This was nothing short of an act of wanton vandalism.']\n",

A valuation by the Valuer General's Office on 11 June 1998 was based on the land being divided into 130 blocks with the provision of a mere 5¼ per cent of the site for public open space. Since it came to office in 1993, the Court Liberal government has engaged in a process of closing down schools and selling the school sites for urban development. On 24 June 1998 the Western Australian state Minister for Education, the Hon. Colin Barnett MLA, issued a press release announcing the closure of the school, despite strong community opposition.

They spoke with pride about their vessel and appreciated the chance to get their points across, emphasising their submarine's advantages and benefits. In the media, I have heard and seen only negative things. None of that was obvious during our inspection. Yes, there are hitches, but everyone was so positive. We came away with a far more balanced view. As usual, the media has sensationalised the issues, portraying the worst scenario. But when you actually go there yourself and talk to the people working with the situation you learn what is really happening. Our service men and women were eager to show off their sub, and I for one enjoyed climbing in it and all around it—although I did baulk at the escape hatch. I believe the member for Blair was under strict instructions to get in the sub after me and to make sure he got out before me just so he did not get stuck.\"]\n",

Back at the base, we were very professionally briefed by Commander Jones and the site manager from Boeing Australia. After a tour of the base, we were introduced to the ADF personnel and associated contractors there.

The banks further consolidated their profits by continuing to shed staff and automate services through ATMs, phone and internet transactions. However, complaints about customer service to the Banking Industry Ombudsman continued to rise into the mid-1990s, with the main complaints concerning the accuracy of advertised rates and information provided on front-end fees. By the late 1990s the banking industry was spending millions of dollars in the `cash for comment' scandal, covert advertising to counter an influential radio commentator's criticism of the banks, and the Banking Industry Ombudsman was still reporting a steady increase in a wide range of complaints.\"]\n",
      "[\"That national picture is certainly repeated in my electorate, and on 17 January 250 residents and aldermen of all political persuasions attended a rally at the Commonwealth Bank in Berala. In the course of 18 months, Berala has suffered a situation where, from having three local banks, it has been reduced to having no banking service. The situation is supposedly to be solved by an agency. In the three years which saw a reduction of 17 per cent in bank branches in this country, we have seen a six per cent reduction in agencies at the same time. The guarantee of the Commonwealth Bank, the last one to get out of town, that this can be solved by the presence of an agency is no long-term guarantee. Over the period I have mentioned, 1,150 banks closed. Citing the example of the Commonwealth Bank, in the period since June 1999 another 17 have closed.

Already shopkeepers are saying to me, `Essentially the shopping centre has got problems. Maybe I should move to Auburn, maybe I should relocate.' Quite frankly, if anyone knows anything about Sydney, if you do not have any banks in Berala, then there are a lot of suburban shopping centres that are far worse in their general support and general interest than this one. So what we are seeing is a general reduction of service which further undermines local traders.

It is particularly heart-rending when you have the feeling that there is nothing within your power that could be done to assist. I almost had that feeling when I had a visit from Corrie Chesworth from Carlingford in my electorate. She told me the story of her foster son, Luke Wheeler, who was born with profound disabilities. He was born blind, with no expressive or receptive language, with epilepsy and cranial hypertension. He suffers repetitious ear, nose and throat infections. He is severely intellectually delayed and he is unable to remain standing, spending most of his time either in his wheelchair or crawling on the floor. She told me that Luke was made a ward of the state shortly after birth and she and her husband Graham adopted him as foster parents when he was 12 months old. He was not expected to live very long but in the care of the Chesworths he has grown and he is now eight years old. He is over 30 kilos, and the Chesworths, now both retired, were having difficulty lifting him in and out of the restraining seat in their car to transport him to and from the Deaf and Blind School at North Rocks that he attends when he is well enough or to his medical appointments. So they said, `We really need a wheelchair accessible vehicle, but all of our disposable income is used up in caring for his medical needs. The Department of Community Services had no money in their budget for it and the Commonwealth likewise do not have a program that would allow us to find the $25,000 we needed for the vehicle.'\"]\n",

We simply told the story of Luke and the Chesworth family and their commitment to this boy and we asked people to help. I wrote directly to the pharmaceutical industrybecause I have found them to be generous in the pastand I was very encouraged when Pfizer pharmaceutical company opened with a $5,000 contribution. That was followed by $1,000 from Eli Lilly Australia and $1,000 from Merck, Sharpe and Dohme. The Parramatta Lions Club kicked in with $1,000. Sigma pharmaceutical company also made a generous contribution. But it was often the smaller donations that had the biggest impact.

So today I stand in the House in the tremendously encouraging position of saying that we are ready to purchase a wheelchair accessible vehicle for Graham and Corrie Chesworth in their care of Luke Wheeler. But I am conscious of the fact that there are literally hundreds of thousands of Australians around the country who are caring for kids with profound disabilities who have not had a community fundraising campaign. In spite of the fact that I am a parched economic dry, if there is one area of government expenditure where I would support wholeheartedly a massive increase it is in this area of those who are caring for kids with profound disabilities. So I just want to thank all of those people who responded and made a contribution.

Isn't it the case that the GST still applies to all these health products and that, whilst the cost of your shaving cream will be reduced under your new tax system, all Australian women will be paying more for sanitary products which were previously exempt from tax on health grounds?

The most effective way of seeing that the benefits of economic change are spread is to provide jobs for those Australians who do not now have them and who are looking for them. On that measure, this government's record has been quite outstanding. We have generated 596,400 jobs and, as of 1 July, there will be another very widely enjoyed benefit.

Even after the increase last month in official interest rates, the average monthly saving on an interest bill has been $266 a month over and above what it was in March 1996. We have seen very high levels of sustained growth. We have seen headline inflation kept at 1.8 per cent compared with an inflation average of five per cent under the former government. Unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition. Since March 1996 employment has grown by almost 6,000, and unemployment in January was 6.8 per cent, which was just over the level of 6.7 per cent, the lowest since June 1990.']\n",

The Labor Party, unlike the Labor Party today, then had a very clear policy on the central issue which the Labor Party is now advocating, namely, a wage earner protection fund as an alternative to priority of employee benefits.

The Labor Party in government was totally opposed to doing anything for workers. When the history of this is written, people will remark on the fact that economic mismanagement led to one million people unemployed, the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression, the worst economic circumstances that Australia had seen in 60 years and thousands of businesses going broke, yet in government it never lifted a finger. It found care and concern for workers only when it thought it could score a political point out of it. We are proud to have taken a decision to provide the first extension of the safety net for workers since superannuation.

The Leader of the Opposition thought somewhat differently. On the same day it was reported that he had indicated that the opposition may accept moves by Telstra to float off parts of its services. He put a couple of conditions on it, but he made it clear that they may accept that. I note that in that same doorstop the spokesman on communications indicated to Telstrain fact, repeated it on a number of occasionsthat Telstra should `get on with its business'.

He said last October that before you would contemplate further privatisation of Telstra you would want to ensure that there was a fully competitive telecommunications market. That has been there for some time. It is on our television screens every night the offers that are being made and the prices that are continually being reduced for the benefits of consumers, and of course the government supports that also. In addition, we know that history is against Labor. The history of Labor is that they support privatisation. In fact, in the first part of the 1990s, Labor sold more than $6 billion worth of public assets under a schizophrenic policy position. They said, `We don't believe in privatisation, but we will sell the Commonwealth Bank; we don't believe in privatisation, but we will sell Qantas; we don't believe in privatisation, but we'll sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.'

At 31 December, just under six million Australians had private health insurance, an increase of 82,000 over the quarter. Interestingly, this is a quarter where you would not normally expect an increase. It was the end of the year. The government were not running their Lifetime Health Cover campaign and we had changed wholesale arrangements and we were expecting some people to drop out from private health insurance. It means that over the calendar year 1999 300,000 people net took out private health insurance.

It was based on advice that he had received from his department and the department's advice, in turn, was based on a letter it had received from the administrator. That letter was not secret. It had been leaked to the Newcastle Herald on the very day that I met the workers in Williamtown. The following, inter alia, is what the letter had to say. In a letter to the federal government, the company administrator, Mr John Star, said that under the deed of company arrangement employee entitlements of $11 million would be matched by allocated funds of just $7.2 million. I will tell you what he goes on to say. This is absolutely crucial to the case being made by the Leader of the Opposition and therefore it is fundamental to my rebuttal of that case, and this was publicly available in the Newcastle Herald on the morning of my meeting with the textile workers in Williamtown, four days before cabinet received a submission from the minister to deal with the issue.

They demonstrate conclusively that there is no case to answer. I acted on all occasions to promote the interests of the workers. My advocacy of the deed of arrangement was not designed to protect my brother. The advocacy of the deed of arrangement was because I believed that would produce the best—the optimum—outcome for the workers in this industry.

That was the beginning of it, and there is nothing novel about governments giving help to the textile industry. National Textiles was helped by the former government and I do not criticise the former government for having done that. The plight of the textile industry, which was the real cause of the collapse of this company, is the ultimate product of years of unwinding tariff protection in this country. That was started by Bob Hawke when he was Prime Minister.

What they asked for, as I have subsequently been advised, was about $23 million, and they were told that they could have $5.7 million. They decided that was not enough, so they called off the merger. That of course precipitated a train of events that was coupled with the fact that the company failed to get the SOCOG contract and also lost a contract for police service uniforms to a company in Victoria.

The New South Wales government at no time sought to have the support package conditional upon the deed of arrangement being signed.

Then it became clear that they were not the only people who were in that category, so you then had to be in an area of high unemployment. Then it became clear that they were not the only ones in that category. The Braybrook example is a perfect parallel where people in the same industry, from an area of even higher unemployment, do not qualify for the special deal. They do not qualify for the 100 per cent pick-up; they miss out.']\n",

The simple fact is that there is one common denominator, there is one clear criterion, that qualifies you for a special deal over and above the national scheme. That one criterion is to have the Prime Minister's brother as the director of the company, able to ring you up on the phone and give you the good oil.\"]\n",

The effect is to protect the directors from further investigation by a liquidator. Everyone in the parliament knows that the ASIC inquiry does not have any direct teeth. Everyone in this parliament knows that for ASIC to pursue any action against the directors, to reclaim any assets from the directors to pay these workers, ASIC must take the matter to the court and argue it out in the court, and it is the court that will then impose such a determination. Had this matter been dealt with by a liquidator, the liquidator could directlyif he was satisfiedgo to the assets of the directors if he found that the directors had behaved in an improper manner.\"]\n",
      "[\"A litany of examples have been given today in question time to identify a whole area of dispute, a whole area of practice amongst the directors over the course of the last year or two, that should be brought into question.

It is no coincidence that last year the directors decided to just about double their professional indemnity, to double their insurance policy against their own liability, in case they did something wrong. Last year they decided to double their own legal protection at the same time as they gave themselves an extra $100,000, but they said to the workers, `Give up a pay increase, and we won't put any money aside for your legal entitlements anyway.' So there is a clear double standard here. But the real villain in this piece is the criteria, the double standards, that have been applied to the adoption of government policya government policy that now says that the only way as a worker you can apparently get 100 per cent of your entitlements is through a special dealnot through the safety net scheme because we know that will not do it for you. Minister Reith's safety net scheme is going to give you back a little bit of what was all yours to start with.

The Prime Minister's office, on 27 January, wrote back to the union and said no. I quote from the letter: \"]\n",

What happened between 27 January and his meeting? He got a phone call from Stan. He got a phone call from Stan after 27 January and, having told the union that he could not meet with them, that his schedule was full up for weeks, he found a time slotnot to meet them here but to meet them over in Newcastle. The phone call from Stan worked wonders. I am sure the workers from Braybrook, who travelled from Melbourne up here to see the Prime Minister and were refused the opportunity to do that, would be interested to know that the Prime Minister was only too willing to meet people as long as Stan rang him first. He was not only happy to meet with them but happy to go to them. This is a Prime Minister whose empathy for them extended not just to meeting with them but to greeting them. Where did he meet and greet them? In a military base. He did not go to the factory. He did not go to Rutherford. He did not go to the hall. He did not go to the creditor's meeting at the workers club in Newcastle. He got a few of them to come into the military base. He sat behind the guarded walls of a military base to meet four of them. That is his idea of sitting down and meeting with these workers and empathising with them. I have to say, though, that that is not bad because a week earlier he wrote to the unions and said he was too busy and could not meet with any of them anyway. It is amazing what the phone call from Stan could produce: a very quick change in the itineraryhop on the plane and off to the air force base to see four of them behind military guards.\"]\n",

For every worker in Australia, the most you are going to get, no matter how much you are owed, is $20,000. I went out to the Rutherford plant twice over the last couple of weeks. I met two people who had been working there for more than 40 years. I met couples that had worked there as a family, and I well recall discussing with them their plight and what they would get from Minister Reith's safety net. As one gentleman said to me, he and his wife had both worked there in excess of 15 years.

Last September we gave the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business the Labor Party's proposal that provides 100 per cent cover for all workers. I am pleased that the Treasurer is on board. The Treasurer has come out publicly and endorsed an insurance based scheme where the employers of Australia shoulder the principal burden.

How much clearer can you get? The formal reply from the New South Wales government in writing to the minister for workplace relations about the package is that it is `an inadequate response'.

Under some pressure about this, Minister Reith decided to back off, because by that stage they did not really want to have a scheme by 1 January. On 24 January, which is not that long ago, Minister Reith said on the Stan Zamanek show, when pressed about this 1 January date: `We didn't say we would have it in place by 1 January.' That is what you did on 24 January. You were dogging it and dodging it, saying, `We don't want a scheme by 1 January and I never said we would have one.' That is what you were saying only a matter of two weeks ago. But by last week it had all changed. It must have been that phone call from Stan. By last week it had all changed again, so by last week we had Minister Reith up on his scrapers saying, `The fact is that we did say last year we were going to start up a scheme.'

When Alan Jones was pressing him about this issue and saying, `This is the workers' money,' what did the Prime Minister say? The Prime Minister actually defended the right of companies to use this workers' money for cash flow purposes. He defended it on four separate occasions in an interview with Alan Jones. Every time he defended it, Alan Jones said, `But it's the workers' money,' and the Prime Minister kept coming back saying, `Because of the cash flow needs of small business, they effectively use that in their day-to-day operations.' Four times he said that. This Prime Minister is not fair dinkum about looking after these workers and he is not fair dinkum about a national scheme. He was not fair dinkum about meeting the workers up there, so he dragged them into a military base. And he is not fair dinkum about a national scheme that provides everyone with 100 per cent cover.

One is the censure over policy, and that generally goes into a general harangue about why the government has got a policy wrong and why it should have acted differently. Matters of controversy and opinion are regularly aired, and it is the stock standard politician's stump speech which is put together and turned into a censure motion. But there is a second type of censure motion that is on rare occasions moved in the House of Representatives. That is the type of censure motion that alleges impropriety of some kind or another. It is treated in this House more seriously. It usually requires some proof. It is usually addressed in a clinical way and it is usually substantiated with cold, hard, empirical facts.

It degenerated into some policy harangue about regional policy, about the Prime Minister's tour, about whatever could be put to fill in the 20 minutes that were remaining for his speech. Of course, the degeneration was ably continued by his shadow minister, who filled his speech out with allegations about the Prime Minister seeing people at military bases, about the Prime Minister engaging in Alan Jones interviews and other serious matters of state which might masquerade where there is no critical audience but will not do in the House of Representatives when an opposition sets out to do something much more important and sets itself a much higher high-jump bar. \"]\n",

A liquidator, to the extent that he could have exercised his powers, would have been doing it out of the assets of the company. ASIC has a budget of, I think, $140 million. Who do you think had the advantage in terms of resources when it came to investigations—a liquidator in an insolvent company or a government agency with $140 million worth of taxpayers' money? Of course ASIC has much greater resources.\"]\n",
      "[\"The second proposition they put was that somehow the liquidator would have had powers to seize assets. I think this was the proposition that was actually put: he would have had the power to seize the assets of the company directors, whereas poor old ASIC would have had to go to court. Of course ASIC would have had to go to court, because we live under the rule of law in this societyand so would a liquidator, incidentally. How do you think a liquidator seizes a company director's assets? Do you think he knocks on the door and says, `This house is now mine'? A liquidator, if he is going to go after the personal assets of a company director, like anybody, has to go to the court and get a court order. He has to get a declaration that this property is available. He has to enforce the law in the same way that ASIC does.\"]\n",
      "[\"The proposition was put forward that somehow ASIC has to abide by the law but liquidators do notthat liquidators just run around seizing assets willy-nilly without any recourse to the law. The first thing that happens when a liquidator goes after a company director's assets is that he takes legal action, and company directors quite frequently defend their rights. There is a proposition that somehow an ASIC investigation is much better than a liquidator's investigation. They are both subject to the rule of law. ASIC can recover compensation. The one difference is that the liquidator probably would not have had the resources, if you want to go into it, or would not have wanted to waste them, and ASIC has $140 million of taxpayers' money. So the proposition that somehow the deed of arrangement shielded the directors in a way that an ASIC investigation would not is, of course, completely preposterous.\"]\n",
      "[\"Then the Leader of the Opposition said, `Hopefully ASIC will have powers in the future.' ASIC has got a lot of powers and we are going to enhance them, but may I say that, if there is a complaint about the powers of ASIC, look to a government that was in power for 13 years. In 13 years we did not get any of these so-called new powers which are now being demanded. We did not get any of these employee entitlement schemes. We did not get any of the things that the Labor Party now so piously claims to be in favour of. I put this proposition: does anybody believe that the Prime Minister was motivated other than by his genuine desire to help the employees of National Textiles? It would not have mattered if the chairman of this company was Simon Crean and it would not have mattered if it was Joe Blow. The fact of the matter is that it was the employees who were getting the money. To use this to sleaze around in relation to people's brothers is a new low in parliamentary standards. Sleazing around about brothers in politics is something that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition may one day live to regret.\"]\n",

This is a situation where the Labor Party claims that the government did precisely what it said it should have done. The scheme operating from 1 January will put in place entitlements which have not been there before. I make this point: there would have been no need to backdate if a scheme had been in place. We could have just carried on the Labor Party's scheme. Backdating only arises because of the failure of Labor. This government has put in place this scheme. This censure is an unfair attempt to sleaze and to slur. The Prime Minister has nothing to be ashamed of. It was a disgraceful censure. It did not even get to first base.

Whilst we support this legislation, we do see it as a matter of some regret that the delays occasioned since this government came to office have necessitated this particular piece of legislation. The intent of codifying the criminal law was announced by the Hawke government and pursued by the Keating administration, in which I was Minister for Justice. In fact, I introduced the legislation that this particular amendment deals with in early 1995. ']\n",
      "['Chapter 2 of that criminal code was intended to provide a uniform expression of how the principles of criminal law might be expressed consistently across not only the Commonwealth but all states and territories. Under subsection 2.2(2), this chapter comes into force as of 15 March 2000. So the framework, if you can imagine it, is that we had discussed the general benefit that could come from a national system of criminal laws, or at least a substantial uniformity in relation to criminal law, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We introduced the Criminal Code Act in order to provide a framework from which the Commonwealth itself would conform all its legislation, and around which we had the hope and expectation that the states and territories would also respond in a positive way in order that we could have a similar system of criminal law applying right across the states and territories.']\n",
      "['Again by way of background, presently even the most fundamental of principles of the criminal law diverge substantially between various states and territories, most noticeably between those jurisdictions that are still common law jurisdictions and those that have adopted various forms of what was originally the Griffith Criminal Code. Similar codes exist, of course, in Tasmania and in other jurisdictions. So, the way in which criminal responsibility is sheeted home in criminal law varies very substantially between various jurisdictions, and it is a matter of considerable confusion to practitioners and, indeed, to those who are subject to it.']\n",
      "[\"When the Criminal Code Act was passed in 1995, it was estimated that it would take approximately five years for the Attorney-General's Department to achieve harmonisation across all Commonwealth legislation of Commonwealth offences, in line with the principles set out in chapter 2 of the criminal code. I think that was a fair time period to allow for that exercise to be conducted. Five years would have been more than adequate had sufficient haste been pressed upon those responsible for the task to have made certain that the legislation ensuring that all Commonwealth legislation was brought into line with these new principles of Commonwealth responsibility, at least at the Commonwealth level, was achieved.\"]\n",
      "['It should also have been an opportunity for substantial advocacy of the benefits of this approach to the states and territories. This has not been the case since the new government came to office. Whilst the process has continued, the opportunity to press their state and territory colleagues on the advantages of moving in harmony with the Commonwealth to develop a common approach has not been particularly well argued or advanced. With the Commonwealth dragging its heels and failing to put much effort into the encouragement of states and territories to come into line, we still have, five years on, the same wretched morass of different principles and inelegantly expressed conflicts that emerge when conflict of law situations arise with respect to the criminal law, and where we, for example, still find ourselves with very difficult questions of jurisdiction arising in relation to conspiracy mattersthe question of whether the Commonwealth law allows for the evolution of new crimes of conspiracy with extraterritorial impact and the likestill emerging as live issues in our jurisprudence.']\n",
      "['The department has advised the government that the process of aligning Commonwealth law has taken longer than anticipated and that it will not be completed by 15 March this year. Therefore, if chapter 2 comes into force as of 15 March this year, it would create practical difficulties. You would have a Commonwealth statute that expresses the principles by which the Commonwealth will operate with respect to all Commonwealth criminal offences not standing neatly with a number of provisions in particular acts that still criminalise specific conduct. That plainly would give rise to the potential for argument about the validity of one provision or the other, and it would certainly create a potential minefield for prosecutions under the offences which had not been harmonised. ']\n",
      "[\"So this legislation extends the application date for subsection 2.2(2) to 15 December of next year. Senator Vanstone's office has asked us to facilitate the swift passage of this legislation so that the amendments can be enforced before 15 March, when we would otherwise have had this situation of the improved general provisionswhich have now been the subject of extensive consultationwhich have been passed and included within Commonwealth legislation for a long period of time, but still with these inconsistencies around the margins remaining. We are certainly happy to accommodate that. Happy is probably the wrong word, but this is an example of the way in which the government and the opposition can work together to facilitate the swift passage of legislation when necessary.\"]\n",
      "[\"We are responsive to the minister's request to assist with a piece of administrative legislation which is necessary to prevent widespread negative implications in the way in which Commonwealth criminal justice legislation and the system operate. It would be churlish for us to say to the government, `Although we are critical of the pace at which you have progressed this, we are going to punish the good administration of justice by creating unnecessary complexities in the administration of criminal law.' That would be a most unsound position for us to take. We are willing and, indeed, quite pleased to support this piece of legislation, in the circumstances. I think it is important to emphasise the words `in the circumstances' because we need to go back to the fundamental reason why the criminal law revision process was undertaken and begun in the late 1980s, continued through the work of the Criminal Law Officers Committee, and then implemented in legislation. \"]\n",
      "['There were two important pieces of national law reform which ought to have moved in parallel. One was to get harmonisation of our criminal lawsat least the basic principles under which criminal law operates, reserving the possibility for particular responses to local circumstances in various states and territories where they might require a particular measure to address a wrong. At the same time, there are certain fundamental questions. For example: at what age can a person be held liable for an act and be prosecuted? How are questions of insanity to be assessed and judged? What mental element is required for the commission of a crime? Is knowledge a necessary element? Is recklessness sufficient? Can mere negligence suffice as the requisite mental state? We felt it was inappropriate that such vital and fundamental bedrock questions about the way in which the criminal law can be expressed can vary so greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We believed that it was important to achieve a national approach in relation to those very fundamental questions. We still believe it is important; indeed, the government believes it is important. It is just that the government is not doing anything to translate that belief into sufficient urgency, orI think more fundamentallyto encourage the states and the territories to proceed with that sense of urgency themselves. If at the end of the day it is only the Commonwealth that enacts this approach, the complexities will be even more unhelpful than they currently are, because you will have the code states, you will the Commonwealth states, and you will have the criminal code provisionswhich are intended to be model provisionsoperating at a Commonwealth level alone and exclusively. ']\n",
      "['The second of the major initiatives that were proposed was reform of the evidence law. I had the privilege of introducing model legislationwhich was intended to operate not only at the Commonwealth level but also at state levelin relation to the admission of evidence in curial proceedings. That has had greater application outside the Commonwealth than the codification of the criminal law. There the Commonwealth has enacted its own legislation which now applies nationally in relation to all Commonwealth matters. That model framework has been adopted and applied in New South Wales and in the ACT. So, in a very large part of Australia, those laws are the basis of common approaches.  ']\n",
      "['Of course, nothing has been added to the achievement that was left to this government when it came to office. No new state has been encouraged to join the scheme of application of the Evidence Act, and there has been no great enthusiasm from the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and Customs, or the Prime Ministernotwith-standing the advantages in the administration of the courts and the convenience for the citizen of having common rules apply in these matters which no longer respect state boundaries. There is no real reason why the method of proof in relation to some particular fact should vary between New South Wales and Victoria. It seems that lawyers now can practise as if there is a national market, in most ways. We are certainly trying to encourage that, but there are still basic differences in the operation of the evidence laws, both in the civil and criminal aspects, between major jurisdictions. And that imposes substantial and unnecessary transaction costs on the legal process. ']\n",
      "['That is not to say that any model law that is introduced in this way is going to be without its critics or not capable of improvement. It should mean that we encourage a process whereby the states work with the Commonwealth, as they do in a number of areas where we have adopted a national approach. The model legislation becomes a template so that all the states and territories get together to see whether or not a particular criticism of a provision is warranted. If they agree, it is changed and it applies right across the country. That is what should happen with the Evidence Act, and that is what should now be under substantial discussion about the criminal code. Remember that the provisions about criminal responsibility in the criminal code that we are passing into legislation in this parliamentand passed into legislation five years agohave been built on year by year.']\n",
      "['I note there will be a debate in this parliament on provisions in relation to fraud and offences of that nature, and we will be discussing the draft that will be included in the Commonwealth legislation. These building blocks of national law-making have involved the states and territories right from the start. The Criminal Law Officers Committee was never an emanation of the Commonwealth; it was an emanation of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. It has been involved in very extensive consultations with the states, the territories and the legal profession and has provided the parliaments with very well thought through drafts in which the reasons for particular directions have been set out and clearly identified and the reasons why some measures have not been supported have been identified, thereby allowing the states and the Commonwealth to have a very clear picture of how to substantially improve the administration of justice.']\n",
      "[\"It is a travesty and a shame that a project of this significance has been given so little priority. I appreciate that, in the toing-and-froing of daily political life, other issues assume importance for the week or the month or the year, and they must be pursued with the urgency that I expect to be accorded to them, but a long-term project of as great a national significance as this will get nowhere unless it is given energy from the leadership of this government—from the Attorney-General, from the Minister for Justice and Customs and indeed from the Prime Minister. It was the urging of the Prime Minister, at the head of government level, which first kicked off this process, and there was a cooperative working through of it by the attorneys and their law officers. Without there being some political imperative, all that good work is likely to be treated simply as an interesting academic exercise, and the long-term national cost will be extreme. It is not something that we will be able to look back on in 15 or so years and say, `This was work which amounted to a substantial achievement,' if all we have, as a result of this enormous endeavour by so many people with great goodwill, is a substantial pile of reports but no adoption, or no commitment to the adoption, of a national scheme by the states and territories and further foot dragging by the Commonwealth in relation to the legislation that it has introduced and passed for its own use.\"]\n",
      "[\"We indicate that we are happy in the circumstances to support this legislation, but those circumstances are most unfortunate. We believe that the momentum for the criminal code project needs to be revitalised. I welcome the discussion paper on chapter 4, `damage and computer offences' and on chapter 2, `jurisdiction'. They are very important developments. I note that the chapter on theft, fraud, bribery and related offences was introduced last November. When those provisions are enacted by this parliament, it will allow us to see a schema of laws which will enable the Commonwealth to say to the states, `We have moved past just legislating general principles of criminal responsibility. You can now see how this applies to the range of offences which are more akin to those which are expressed in your state legislation.' On that basis, there should be an opportunity to gain some greater agreement between Commonwealth and state attorneys on a time frame whereby we will move towards harmonisation on the basis of this model criminal code. \"]\n",
      "['The task is one which never excites great media interestit is not one which you can get on the front page of a tabloid newspaperbut it is a waste of human resources and it is a lost opportunity. To place Australia in the position it could be in, if we worked this thing through properly so that there was harmonisation of our approach on evidence and criminal law, would be of enormous benefit to a public that is concerned about law and order at a very simple level and concerned to make certain that we have a legal framework which is responsive and adequate to deal with the prosecution of crime. It would also address an economic advantage that would flow from having common principles whereby lawyers could, with confidence, advise their clients about admissibility of evidence notwithstanding which jurisdiction they practised in. It would enable decisions as to whether or not an action might be in breach of some prohibition of the criminal law to be assessed again without any regard to the jurisdictional issues. All of these advantages would flow from a serious recommitment to this national project.']\n",
      "[\"I appreciate that the government is batting on with thisI would certainly be much more critical had it abandoned this national projectbut it does seem to me that we are not much better off by a continuation of a program of work which is not now geared to see a positive outcomeby way of pressure, encouragement, enthusiasm and advocacywith the states and territories. It really is important to go back to that fundamental agreement that the Prime Minister and premiers reached years and years ago and to the bedrock agreement that was reached between the Attorneys and their law officers that this was a task of great importance and that we would engage in this in a cooperative and constructive way with the national interest at the front of our minds rather than with the view that we would seek to retain difference and complexity in our laws for the sake of it. It really is a fundamental and important issue of national significance which has been allowed to slip down the agendano doubt under the pressure of a whole range of other issues which have been coming onto the government's agenda and perhaps also because it was the child of the previous Labor administration. I would hate to feel that that was part of the feeling, but there is, I imagine, no small sense that it is better to bat on and get up your own raft of achievements rather than to progress that of a previous administration. I suppose it would be a bit optimistic to expect anything other than that kind of response. But, once we get past that, we ought to realise that there is a national imperative here and really get behind this scheme, get behind the idea that motivated it in the first place and get back to some serious talking about a timetable for its national implementation. I know that the government believes that this issue should not be abandoned and it will continue with itso I am reassured on that scorebut there needs to be far more whole of government commitment to it than has hitherto occurred.\"]\n",

Indeed, they were my advisers at one stageso, extraordinarily persuasive. I do welcome that continuation of the project. It is not, as I say, going to be an issue that will catch the imagination of the tabloid media—it might not catch the imagination of any of the media—but it ought to catch the imagination of the media that we have passed the five-year period without this coming into effect because of delay. That is essentially what has happened. We have not been able to meet benchmarks we setI do not think unreasonablyin order to bring about the harmonisation of Commonwealth provisions in relation to criminal law responsibility, let alone to provide a sufficiently advanced model to the states and territories to encourage them to be more than interested spectators in this process.

So it is going to replace the present provision which states that chapter 2 will apply on the day five years after the day on which the Criminal Code Act received royal assent. In essence, this replacement provision provides a 20-month extension. ']\n",
      "['I make the unremarkable observation, in response to the predictable line run by the member for Denison, that, given the extension of time sought, a better outcome will occur in the administration of justice. Within this time frame, further adjustments can be made to offences to enable them to operate appropriately once the criminal code does apply to them. In other words, if the criminal code were to apply to all offences as from 16 March 2000 as originally anticipated, there would be problems for prosecutions as, we are advised, it would not be possible to adjust all of the offences before that date, in particular defining the date on which chapter 2 of the code applies to other acts as necessary because many Commonwealth criminal offences have not been harmonised in accordance with its principles and prosecutions could be affected. For example, where there are strict liability offences, they would automatically lose their strict liability status unless they had all been amended to expressly designate them as strict liability offences.']\n",
      "[\"I would have thought that any prospect of there being a technical problem with prosecutions that would lead to increased costs being incurred because of difficulties with prosecutions ought to be avoided, as I am sure the member for Denison would have agreed, hence the necessity for the passage of this bill. But the member for Denison says, `Oh, well, I have thought about it and, in my view, going back five years ought to be enough time.' That is a simplistic enough charge, but since the Criminal Code Act 1995 was enacted it has become apparent that the overall task of developing and implementing the criminal code has proved to be far more onerous than originally anticipated, particularly given the number of offences under the various Commonwealth laws that require review and, if necessary, amendment in order to comply with and to harmonise in accordance with the general principles of criminal responsibility contained in the criminal code. \"]\n",
      "['The criminal code is a significant step in the evolution of our system of justice. Just to put that into context, I refer to the background of the Gibbs committee. The committee was chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs and it sought to review all the Commonwealth criminal laws. It recommended in 1987 that there be general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law, recognising the need to review the system where principles applicable to Commonwealth offences were disparate and inequitable. Just to illustrate the point, common law principles apply if the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914. However, the major application of the Crimes Act relates to Commonwealth offices and property, and the great raft of Commonwealth offences is created in other statutes. So the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that, when a state or territory court is exercising federal jurisdiction in a criminal case arising under statute other than the Crimes Act, the question of criminal responsibility must be decided according to the relevant state or territory law.']\n",
      "['This code seeks to ensure, for example, that the situation can no longer occur where two people convicted of the same Commonwealth offence in different states may be subject to different rules. Those rules can have a substantive impact on the outcome of any prosecution. Take, for example, the different consequences that flow from differences in Commonwealth and state laws. Under the Crimes Act the age of seven is the age of criminal responsibility. However, the offence, charge, may not be against the Crimes Act, it may be against another Commonwealth statute, and the age of criminal responsibility varies throughout the jurisdictions; thus the place where the court is held will determine the age which applies. So the idea that there should be one Commonwealth criminal law is not hard to fathom in those circumstances on the grounds of both consistency and equity.']\n",
      "[\"The model criminal code addresses a wide range of offences under Commonwealth laws including assault, stalking, abduction, sexual offences, homicide, conspiracy to defraud, perjury and the like. The states and territories of Australia have already adopted various components of the model criminal code. There has been a deal of cooperation, but there is now a necessity to defer for a relatively short while the implementation of chapter 2. As I have said, chapter 2 contains the criminal code's general principles of criminal responsibility, which are ultimately intended to apply generally to all Commonwealth criminal offences. Chapter 2 was in fact the first substantive chapter to be included in the criminal code, for it deals with the general principles of criminal responsibility applying to all offences created by any law of the Commonwealth. This includes principles ranging from the common elements of offences such as conduct and intention to secondary offences such as attempt, complicity, incitement and conspiracy. The principles in chapter 2 also relate to general issues such as capacity, the age of criminal responsibility, to which I have referred, and the burden and standard of proof.\"]\n",
      "[\"While the federal government supports the model criminal code, I hasten to point out that it is confined to Commonwealth laws. Given the headlines in this morning's media on the matter of Western Australian and Northern Territory laws on mandatory sentencing, I make the point that that issue is dealing with state and territory sentenc-ing lawsstate and territory criminal lawswhich are the responsibility of the demo-cratically elected state parliaments and that, as federal parliamentarians, we should not ever forget that federalism is the best system of government in the world. It allows for the dispersal of power while maintaining a cohesive nation state. It enables democratically elected parliaments to deal with specific issues at regional levels. \"]\n",
      "['That is essential in a nation of the geography and demography of Australia and, if there is no constitutional basis for doing so, the federal parliament should exercise extreme caution before even thinking it can assume or presume to have a role in determining state laws emanating from state parliaments. We must ensure that we maintain the laudable democratic federalist objectives that have served this country so well. But, in contradistinction, the model criminal code, the subject of this bill, has its value and its importance as a national tool in the Commonwealth criminal law field, emphasised in the ever changing circumstances of cybercrime. To highlight the sort of work that the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has to deal with, just last week the Minister for Justice and Customs released a model criminal code discussion paper in relation to chapter 4, defining new criminal penalties involving computer offences. In such a dynamic environment as the computer technology world, laws including criminal laws need to be updated.']\n",
      "['Existing computer offences, for example, are less than 10 years old in many instances, yet many are already outdated. With the increasing use of electronic communications throughout Australia and the increasing use of the Internet for transactions, there is greater susceptibility for computer crimes to take hold. We only have to take the recent hacker attacks on the America Online and Yahoo web sites and other major Internet portals to see the need for criminal laws on a national basis to address crimes that know no boundaries such as the unauthorised impairment of electronic communications computer sabotage and the like. The model criminal code discussion paper on this sort of crime adds an element to make it an offence to use a computer with the intention of committing a serious offence. The punishment for committing such an offence using a computer would be the same as if the person had committed the serious offence concerned.']\n",
      "['So the government is taking steps to keep abreast of the changing face of crime in the technological world. In relation to this bill, it is quite straightforward. In 1995 the parliament set the five-year period described in subsection 2.2(2) with the view that this would allow sufficient time for all offences under Commonwealth law to be reviewed and, if necessary, amended in order to comply with the general principles of criminal responsibility contained within the criminal code. As it turns out, more time to achieve that objective is required. I thank the member for Denison for stating that the bill is not opposed and, in those circumstances, I commend this bill to the House.']\n",
      "#######\n",
      "[\"The Criminal Code Amendment (Application) Bill presently before the House allows for deferral of the application of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act, which contains the criminal code's general principles of criminal responsibility and which are ultimately intended to apply generally to all Commonwealth criminal offences. As it currently operates, the provisions of chapter 2 of the act will commence on 16 March 2000, the prescribed five years from the date of royal assent. This bill also provides that the new commencement date for the operation of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act will be 15 December 2001. This time frame is necessary to allow the period of review and adjustment to be properly concluded across all Commonwealth legislation. At the conclusion of this time frame the principles of the criminal code will generally apply to all offences under Commonwealth law. A deferral until December 2001 will allow the review and adjustment process to be properly conducted across all Commonwealth legislation and will ensure adequate time to harmonise Commonwealth criminal offences with the principles of criminal responsibility in the criminal code.\"]\n",
      "['If some of these offences are not properly adjusted, they will become more onerous for the prosecution to prove, as many Commonwealth criminal offences have not been harmonised with its principles. The presence of anomalies in the criminal justice system, whether it be at Commonwealth or state and territory level, is one of the primary reasons why the federal government instigated the model criminal code project to which this bill relates. The model criminal code project will lead to more consistent laws around Australia and greater clarity in criminal offences. For example, in the case of offences against the person which result in death, there is a great deal of inconsistency and confusion. It is quite concerning that, even with offences as serious as murder, Australians cannot travel in their own country and be sure they have the same level of protection they would have in another part of the country. ']\n",
      "['Indeed, in the New South Wales jurisdiction, there is a partial defence of diminished responsibility in certain cases of murder, yet when you cross the border into Victoria the defence of diminished responsibility does not operate. At present there are also inconsistencies between the states and territories in the number and types of offences as well as the maximum penalties. This situation must strike many Australians as passing strange. What is justice in one Australian state is sometimes a crime in another. Both states cannot be right in their interpretation of the defence of diminished responsibility. There are also inconsistencies in sentencing laws that operate in Australian criminal jurisdictions which the model criminal code is seeking to improve. Take, for example, the current treatment of the charge of intentionally causing serious harm. There is an inconsistent treatment of a variety of criminal offences in different criminal jurisdictions in Australia.']\n",
      "[\"In the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, the maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment, in Western Australia the maximum penalty is 20 years while in Tasmania and New South Wales the maximum penalty is 21 and 25 years respectively. Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory carry maximum life sentences for the same crime. Therefore, the range of maximum sentences for intentionally causing serious harm in Australia is 15 years to life imprisonmenta very wide margin by most people's standards. Under the model criminal code, the sentence for the previously mentioned crime of intentionally causing serious harm is 20 to 25 years. Given that the range of maximum sentences among the states and territories is 15 years to life, 20 to 25 years appears to be a reasonable maximum sentence.\"]\n",
      "['Consider also the serious crime of kidnapping. In Australia the maximum sentence ranges from 14 years in Queensland to 25 years in Victoria and a maximum of life imprisonment in my home state of South Australia. Under the model criminal code, the maximum sentence is 15 to 19 years imprisonment. The current debate over mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory is another situation which may benefit from using the model criminal code. I know that the member for Curtin touched on that subject in her speech from the point of view of the federal system of government under which we operate. I agree with her that the federal system of government is the most efficient and the best system of government and has proven to be of great benefit to Australia in the last 100 years.']\n",
      "[\"However, there are issues that need to be considered with respect to the mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory which might take some careful consideration. For example, in the Northern Territory the judicial discretion that we have always regarded as critical in our system of justice, which is important to the independence of a judge in making a decision about the circumstances of a person and what sort of punishment would fit the crime, has been taken away in that territory. Of course, because the Northern Territory is not a state, the same rules do not apply as would apply in Western Australia. The Commonwealth would be required to use its law of external affairs to intervene in Western Australia, which we would naturally be loath to do. However, in the Northern Territory, under section of 122 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth could intervene in the Northern Territory's laws, and there may well be a case for doing so. That is probably a matter for another day.\"]\n",
      "['On that subject, I will finish by saying that I do support the Attorney-General in his actions of writing to the attorneys-general of the Northern Territory and Western Australia and asking them to review the situation in those two jurisdictions with respect to mandatory sentencing. I would suggest to both of the attorneys-general, particularly the Northern Territory, that the arguments have gone far enough with respect to mandatory sentencing in that territory and the egregious examples that I could list today, but choose not to, of minor offences for which people have been incarcerated are an embarrassment for that territory and an embarrassment for the nation. ']\n",
      "['Some of the inconsistencies that arise in criminal law at both state and territory level are often a result of the two different approaches to criminal lawthe common law approach and the codified law approach. Criminal law in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia is based on the common law approach. In these jurisdictions, while a significant proportion of offences are contained in specific acts and regulations, many are based on non-legislative common law principles. This arrangement lends itself to subtle but consistent changes to the law. Whilst it is essential that the law continues to evolve, too much change too quickly is not necessarily the optimal situation. This is in contrast to the criminal law in Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, which is based on a comprehensive criminal code in each of those jurisdictions. The model criminal code should not be interpreted as diminishing state rights in these areas. Rather, it is about delivering uniformity and consistency throughout criminal law jurisdictions in Australia.']\n",
      "['The primary task of developing the model criminal code was given to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which established the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. The membership of this committee comprises criminal law experts from various jurisdictions. Substantive offences relating to the following areas have all been developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee for the model criminal code: the administration of justice; conspiracy to defraud; damage and computer offences; fatal offences against the person; general principles of criminal responsibility; non-fatal offences against the person; offences against humanity such as slavery; public order offences like the contamination of goods; serious drug offences; sexual offences against the person; and theft, fraud, bribery and related offences. Encouragingly, many of the states and territories have adopted various components of the model criminal code. As a result, Australians are being given greater certainty, protection and confidence under the law.']\n",
      "['But, despite this progress, there is still a considerable amount of work to be done to harmonise Commonwealth offences with the criminal code. The assignment of developing and implementing the criminal code has proven to be more comprehensive than initially expected when the Criminal Code Act was passed in 1995. The model criminal code is one of the most important reforms to the criminal justice system. But for these reforms to have full effect it is necessary that they be implemented properly. This bill helps ensure that outcome by making sure that it is not implemented before its time.']\n",
      "#######\n",
      "['I also rise to speak to the Criminal Code Amendment (Application) Bill 1999. I would like to add to the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Sturt, and also to those made by the member for Curtin. This legislation has been introduced to defer the implementation date for the criminal code from 16 March 2000 to 15 December 2001. Firstly, I would like to make it clear that this government is strongly committed to the implementation of the criminal code. We look forward to seeing the completion of this process and a uniform application of the criminal code to a wide range of criminal offences. In 1995, the previous government set a relatively ambitious five-year target to review all offences under the Commonwealth law and amend them to meet the principles of the criminal code. Whilst there has been significant progress towards the development of a model criminal code, there are still aspects of chapter 2 relating to the general principles of criminal responsibility in relation to Commonwealth criminal offences that need to be reviewed. I know that all my colleagues agree that a project as important as the model criminal code needs to be thought out carefully and thoroughly implemented. It should not be rushed through, at any rate. ']\n",
      "['Deferring the commencement of the code for even this very short period will ensure that the review and adjustment process can be properly concluded. With the project nearing completion, more resources can now be devoted to the process of ensuring implementation by the end of the extension period. Between now and 15 December 2001, offences can be harmonised with general principles of the criminal code, ensuring that no difficulties occur in the prosecution process. It is therefore reasonable in the interest of effective legal practices to defer the legislation to the later date.']\n",
      "['I would like to take a moment to cover the progress that has already been made with the development of the criminal code. After extensive cooperation by the states, the model criminal code now covers offences across a wide variety of topics. These include: conspiracy to defraud, assault, stalking, abduction, sexual offences, homicide, perjury, threatening witnesses, drug trafficking, the contamination of goods, and slavery and sexual servitude. The section of the Commonwealth criminal code dealing with slavery and bribery of foreign public officials offences passed through the parliament late last year, and the criminal code amendment bill dealing with theft, fraud, bribery and related offences was introduced into the parliament on 24 November last year. These issues raise a high level of concern among the community and need to be dealt with in a just and considered way.']\n",
      "['I feel particularly strongly about the issue of slavery and sexual servitude and spoke to the criminal code amendment bill dealing with this issue in August last year. In that speech, I commended the work that was being done at the time by the Minister for Justice and Customs in developing a policy framework that dealt with such an ugly aspect of human behaviour. As I discussed at the time, I had been alarmed by the Australian Federal Police report of August 1997 that stated that there had been 14 cases of women brought into this country for the purpose of sexual servitude and slavery. The Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Servitude) Bill 1999 looked at inadequacies between the Commonwealth, state and territory laws on sex trafficking and empowered law enforcers with stricter penalties for these traffickers.']\n",
      "['This is just one of the examples of the horrific offences that are being dealt with already under the criminal code project, and I look forward to more criminal code amendments being passed by the parliament much later this year. It has taken an incredible amount of resources to develop the criminal code and to develop it to this point, and the level of cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and territories on this project has been a very valuable and commendable achievement. As we all know, it is indeed a very rare thing to see cooperation and coordination between the states and territories.']\n",
      "[\"The Criminal Code Act 1995 was designed to achieve codification and uniformity of the criminal law, with codification as the primary aim. Codification has been supported for much of Australia's legal history. Sir Samuel Griffith, who drafted the Queensland Criminal Code in 1897, called for a `collected and explicit statement of the criminal law' over a century ago. The criminal code project aims to deliver a body of criminal law that is much more easily understood by the Australian public and legal practitioners. That is to be commended. But in practical terms, as a non-lawyer we have heard a number of lawyers speaking here todaythe greatest meaning for me and others will be that the criminal code project will attempt to bring together existing criminal law in a plain English format. It is to be commended for that particular initiative. There are great disparities between states. We heard a number of speakers here today mention those disparities. There are disparities between state and Commonwealth, and this legislation will aim to bring a lot of uniformity to separate bodies of criminal law. I know that law enforcement officers in all states of Australia will be very grateful for that. Currently there are nine separate bodies of law dealing with property crime alone. The code will certainly overcome these potentially costly and time wasting differences by bringing consistency and simplicity to the body of criminal law. Additionally, codification should also address issues that arise when offences are committed across several states or internationally.  \"]\n",
      "['It is important to note that the criminal code project strives for a balance between certainty and flexibility in criminal law. Our laws should be consistent, yet they also should be adaptable to the changing nature of criminal offences in our society. It is sad to see the impact of the increase in crime in our society. Recently in Brisbane it was highlighted in the middle of an incredible heatwave we had when some 15 elderly women and men died. The fact that they passed away in their homes was often related to being barricaded in their homes and not allowing adequate ventilation. A lot of that has to do with a sense of feeling inadequate and unempowered in relation to the increase in crime. Particularly elderly people are very vulnerable. It is therefore critical that the process of reviewing and adapting law for the criminal code is conducted in a very careful and thorough manner.']\n",
      "['I fully support deferring the implementation of the code until December next year, for the reasons I have outlined. Once completed, I know that the criminal code will deliver greater certainty and protection under the criminal law for all Australians. I wish to commend the bill and also congratulate the minister for the fine work he has put in in ensuring that this bill has come to the House.']\n",

      "['in reply—I thank the members for Denison, Curtin, Sturt and Petrie for their speeches on the Criminal Code Amendment (Application) Bill. I am pleased that we can now proceed to make the necessary changes proposed in the amendments. Great progress has been made in the development of the model criminal code, and the overall task of developing and implementing the code has proven more extensive than originally anticipated. The bill defers the application of some parts of the Criminal Code Act to allow for all Commonwealth offences to be harmonised with the criminal code. When the code was originally enacted on 15 March 1995, the previous government estimated that it would take five years to review the many hundreds of existing Commonwealth offences to which the code was intended to apply. It has become clear that this estimate was too optimistic. Presently, chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act dealing with the general principles of criminal responsibility to apply to all Commonwealth criminal offences will come into effect on 16 March 2000. This bill defers that date of application to 15 December 2001. After that time the principles of the criminal code will generally apply to all offences under Commonwealth law. The development of the criminal code is a significant step in the evolution of our system of justice and it is important that it be implemented in a way that is considered and pays careful regard to the way Commonwealth offence provisions are to work in practice.']\n",
      "['The honourable member for Denison has remarked that this deferral should not have been necessary if the code had been given greater priority. It is important to remember that the model criminal code, which includes everything from theft, fraud and bribery to offences against the person to drug offences, already represents a tremendous achievement in Commonwealth, state and territory cooperation. However, considerable resources have been used in the negotiation and development of the code. These resources have also been directed to developing other important law reform projects in conjunction with the code, including the model domestic violence laws and the model forensic DNA procedures bill. One has only to take a passing glance at the 300-page model criminal code discussion paper on damage and computer offences, which was released on the weekend, to realise the amount of work involved in a project of this nature. ']\n",
      "['We have also made significant progress in relation to the development of the Commonwealth criminal code with the passage of slavery and bribery of foreign public officials offences last year and the introduction of the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill on 24 November 1999. Much has been achieved, and therefore it is quite clear that the proposed modest extension to the timetable is both reasonable and sensible. We anticipate that the necessary amendments will be completed before the expiry of the revised date. The model criminal code is almost completed and the task has been given greater priority on the legislative program. Over the coming year you will see a number of bills which specifically deal with the necessary changes. I thank members for their wisdom in agreeing to the passage of the proposed amendments. ']\n",

      "['The opposition welcomes the Ministers of State and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and will be supporting it. Essentially the purpose of the bill is to facilitate payment of parliamentary secretaries for the very substantial extra responsibilities they bear. Since the office of parliamentary secretary was first established in 1980, the duties which attach to the office have grown significantly. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has pointed out in his second reading speech,  these include responsibility for handling legislation and taking on statutory and representational responsibilities on behalf of the minister. Parliamentary secretaries also attend to many administrative and departmental matters.']\n",

The Remuneration Tribunal, in its report of 7 December 1999, recommended that parliamentary secretaries be paid a loading of 25 per cent of their base salary or $22,500 annually. The bill will facilitate this by amending the Ministers of State Act 1952 to enable the 12 parliamentary secretaries appointed under section 64 of the Constitution to be covered by that act. The bill will also increase from $1.622 million to $2.3 million the maximum annual sum for the payment of ministerial salaries, to give effect to the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendation of 7 December.\"]\n",
      "['I might also make a few observations, as a parliamentary secretary in a former government. The development of parliamentary secretaries has seen individuals who hold those responsibilities take on responsibilities in policy and administration in personnel mattersin budgetary terms an area of responsibility that would equate and in many cases exceed the responsibility held by state ministers in many state governments. Parliamentary secretary is an important position. It has aided and assisted both the function of government and the function of parliament and has developed over the last two decades to provide additional services and support in the delivery of programs and in the development of policy. This is, I think, a long overdue alteration. The opposition is happy to see its passage through the parliament. We regard the levels of remuneration as commensurate with the heavy responsibilities of ministers and parliamentary secretaries and support the bill.']\n",

This has been a vexed area for government for many years. The Constitution does not really propose or even hint at the position of parliamentary secretary, but in fact successive governments have found it a very useful mechanism to augment and assist ministers' work.\"]\n",
      "['I notice that the Parliamentary Secretaries Bill 1980 was introduced by the Minister for Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ian Viner. At the time, that legislation was opposed by the Labor Party, but coming into office in 1993 they quickly found it a useful mechanism to assist ministers. One commentator describes the role of a parliamentary secretary as accomplishing better management of ministerial workload by offloading or devolving routine, tedious, non-policy or ceremonial duties, thereby freeing the minister to devote more time to policy matters, major aspects of departmental administration and matters truly and essentially appertaining to ministerial responsibility; to obtain a larger ministerial team without incurring the financial or political cost of formally enlarging the ministry; to enlarge the support group for the ministry within caucus or the joint party room to deliver political rewards to friends and allies and to avert political disharmony or disunity; and to give training and experience to likely candidates for office. I think anybody who has been a parliamentary secretary would think that that commentator could do with some extension of the definitions because, as my colleague has outlined, the role of parliamentary secretary has gone far beyond that which was first envisaged.

      "['I would like to pay tribute to the Hon. Chris Miles for the work that he did as Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister because much of the groundwork in the legislation we see before us today was put in place by him. He saw the problem of parliamentary accountingas they had tofor exact expenditure on a day-to-day basis because they ran the risk of being charged with taking a profit under the Crown. That was certainly non-constitutional and illegal and Chris Miles saw the need to formalise the role of parliamentary secretary. I know that he struggled with that. We have today a solution which I think is a good solution. This legislation provides for a process whereby parliamentary secretaries may be remunerated by salary to the extent of $22,500 per annum as they are appointed under section 64 of the Constitution.']\n",

Why is there a need? The role of parliamentary secretary is ill definedin fact, it is not defined at allso this bill gives a definition to `parliamentary secretary'. Whatever the verbal gymnastics either side of politics might use, this bill creates a greatly expanded ministry. It repeals the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980 and amends the Ministers of State Act 1952 to increase the size of the federal ministry from 30 to 42.\"]\n",

According to Margaret Healy in a 1993 article on the role of parliamentary secretaries, one definition of the job is to help with the better management of the ministerial workload by off-loading tedious non-policy or ceremonial duties. That is the PR side of ministerial work: the handout of  the cheque to local organisations, which is a procedure that bypasses the federal member unless he or she belongs to the party in government. It is an entirely cynical and political role that the elector can see through and which, I put to this House, is a waste of time and effort and, most importantly, a waste of taxpayers' money.\"]\n",

Just behind them is the third row and the really hopeful further back, all within possible reach of an extra reward that maintains their discipline and ensures their protest is confined to the party room. Such protest is expressed in here only at grave cost to their career path. The first step on that path is, of course, becoming a parliamentary secretary.']\n",

On 26 November 1980, when Mr Viner made that speech, I believe it began the gradual widening rather than closing of the gap between the executive and parliament, and hence the gap between the people and their House, a process that has been accelerated by the increase from four, eight and then 10 parliamentary secretaries during the Hawke and Keating governments to 12 parliamentary secretaries in both the Howard administrations.

No; rather the government takes the deceptive route of simply altering the status of parliamentary secretaries to officers under section 64 of the Constitution and enables them to receive a salary rather than an expenses of office allowance.

That would be objectionable enough, but it also involves a net increase in cost to the budget of well over half a million dollars a year. Each parliamentary secretary is to lose their present entitlement in expenses of office allowance, excluding travel allowance, of $10,000 per annum and in its place will receive an annual salary of $22,500 per annum.

Figures now eight years old show that it cost $1.3 million per member or senator to run this place in 1992. I pointed out the culture that exists within parliamentary departments that have turned a blind eye to waste. It is a culture that has successfully thwarted reform attempts. The latest example is a Parliament House works management project to construct $3.7 million worth of landscaping to courtyards of this parliament due to begin in April and to be completed in time for Federation celebrations. I am sure the taxpayer believed this place had been completed in 1988 at a cost of $1.1 billion.

      "[\"The bills before the House this evening are supplementary appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4. I want to explain some of the fiscal background to these two pieces of legislation, which of course are routine legislation in the normal life of the parliament but do give some insight into recent developments with respect to the government's fiscal strategy, in particular matters that have arisen since the budget in May of last year. The first point that needs to be made is that we are living through a very substantial deterioration in the fiscal position of the Commonwealth, which was outlined in some detail in the recently released mid-year economic and financial outlook documents. What they showed for the forthcoming financial year of 2000-01 was an estimate that outlays would be almost $6 billion higher than was previously estimated and that revenue would increase by about only $3½ billiontherefore, a net deterioration in the overall position of the surplus of around $2½ billion. A similar deterioration can be seen in the out year of 2001-02, where the outlays are anticipated to increase by up to $6.6 billion and revenue is expected to increase by only $4.3 billion, and in the further out year of 2002-03, where outlays are expected to increase by $7 billion and revenue is expected to increase by only $5.5 billion. It is an overall picture of significant deterioration in the fiscal position of the Commonwealth.\"]\n",
      "['The underlying circumstances for this are mixed. It must be said that some are entirely legitimate and derive from decisions of the parliament and the government, which were supported by the opposition. Most particularly, they derive from the commitment of the Australian government to East Timor, which is estimated to cost the Commonwealth somewhere in the vicinity of $3.4 billion over four years. This was clearly not anticipated at the time of the budget last year. That amount will be partly defrayed by the proceeds from the East Timor levy, which will come into effect for the forthcoming financial year and will raise slightly under $900 million. The second factor of considerable magnitude in producing the fiscal deterioration is the dirty deal done between the Democrats and the government to get the GST legislation through the parliament. This is expected to cost the surplus roughly $2.5 billion over three years. In the first of the three years, it will cost about $1.8 billion.']\n",
      "['There are a number of other factors involved. The social bonus associated with the sale of Telstra has been increased by about $280-odd million over four years and, most importantly, there are a variety of overspends, that is, numerous circumstances where the amounts spent by the Commonwealth have been significantly higher than those originally estimated in the budget. This particularly applies to the subsidy to private health insurance which, as we have seen in very recent times, is now running at around $2.2 billion a year. There have also been a number of overspends in mainstream areas such as pensions, youth allowance, service pensions and benefits. These have derived ultimately from estimation problems. For example, an overestimation of the mortality rate of veterans was a factor involved in the case of pensions and benefits for ex-service persons and war widows and the like. The end result of all this, of course, is that we have this significant blow-out in the budget. It is also worth keeping in mind that the government has bolstered the short-term position of the budget by deferring $6.3 billion of the proceeds of the second tranche of the sale of Telstra and $676 million of the proceeds of the Reserve Bank trading in the currency market into the 2000-01 year.']\n",
      "[\"The core problem that the government has fiscally is the fiscal loosening associated with roughly $17 billion of tax cuts over three years designed to sweeten the GST and, of course, are heavily weighted to favour higher income earners. The government is now caught in a vicious cycle where it is pumping up the economyin effect by this fiscal looseningat a time when you have got the economy growing quite strongly. It has been growing now for nine years, which is well back into the previous government's term in office. It is now growing by over four per cent per annum. You will see a substantial boost to that growthrisking overheating of the economycoming from the tax package as it is implemented on 1 July this year. Essentially it is because of that and the GST that we saw interest rates increase by half a percentage point only a week or two ago. The net effect of that interest rate increase is that for many people it wipes out the theoretical net benefit from the tax cuts. \"]\n",
      "[\"We all remember from the election campaign and subsequent material related to the GST and the tax package that everybody was told how much they are going to get as a result of the implementation of the tax package, that particular categories of families would get $10 a week and some would get $50 a week. Even if you take all of these things at face value, which I suspect is very hard to do, and look at the impact of a half percent increase in interest rates, you see that people who are single, with a mortgage and who earn under $40,000 in income; single income families with two children and a mortgage, who earn under $20,000 a year in income; dual income families with no children, a mortgage and who earn less than $60,000; and dual income families with two children and a mortgage and who earn less than $45,000 a year, the impact of the interest rate increase is that it wipes out any positive advantage that they purportedly would get from the tax cuts above and beyond the impact of the GST. Those people are immediately shifted onto the loser column, and it is pretty clear that the government's estimation of net benefits to people as a result of the tax package was wildly optimistic in any event.\"]\n",
      "['We all got used to the Treasurer, in particular, and the Prime Minister over the past few years announcing in the chamber to everybody how they had delivered low interest rates to Australia and what a wonderful achievement that was. It came as no surprise to any of us that, when interest rates started going up again, suddenly interest rates in Australia were determined by international forces, that there were a variety of other matters there, that it was nothing to do with the government and nothing to do with anything the government may have done.']\n",
      "['There has been some degree of debate in the community and in the financial press about the question of the nexus between the GST and the tax package on the one hand and the increase in interest rates on the other. Clearly, the increase in interest rates, both the increase towards the end of last yearthe quarter of a per centand the more recent one, relates to inflation and prospective inflation and it can be seen as a pre-emptive strike. That is certainly what the Reserve Bank has put forward and certainly what the government has indicated its view is.']\n",
      "['In considering the question of the connection between the GST and this pre-emptive strike against inflation and the increase in interest rates, it is important to remember that the impact of the GST on inflation is not restricted to the headline impact of the initial leap in prices that will occur post 1 July as a result of the introduction of the GST. But that clearly is a significant factor. It is beyond belief that that increase will totally wash out of the system and that it will be a totally one-off event. Clearly, as a result of the increase in prices derived from the GST, you will see some wages effect and you will see some prices effect because no market is perfect and no government regulation is perfect. How big that effect will be is yet to be seen.']\n",
      "['It is important to remember that the impact of the GST package on prospective inflation and therefore on interest rates is not restricted to that headline impact. This is where the fiscal impact of the tax cuts comes in because, clearly, the threat of fuelling inflation is significant when you pump an extra $6 billion or $7 billion a year in discretionary spending power into the economy at a time when it is growing at over four per cent per annum. That is effectively what is happening. Why? Because of the GST. It is in order to sweeten the GST and to ensure that enough people are prepared to live with it in order to keep the government in officea vain hope, I have no doubt, but, nonetheless, that is why it is being done.']\n",
      "[\"So, when you put those two things together, there can be no doubt that the recent increase in interest rates is directly connected to the government's tax package and to the GST. One might also throw in a few lesser effects which have yet to really manifest themselves; nonetheless, they are worth keeping in mind. For example, there is the emerging problem of skills bottlenecks, which has a clear nexus with cuts in funding for TAFE, for universities and for labour market programs and the like. Of course, there is also the recent Job Network fiasco. So, there is a variety of inflationary pressures. There are other matters such as the recent trending down of the Australian dollar, the current account deficit, which is still very high, and excessive consumption and excessive consumer debt—all of these factors are contributing to inflationary pressures in Australia's economy. \"]\n",
      "['When a government comes along and adds to that, through a tax package that involves both releasing a substantial amount of consumer spending power into the economy at a time when the economy is growing strongly and giving an artificial boost to prices, which, in theory, should be a once-off but in practice clearly will not be, then you have the circumstances which give you cause to increase interest rates. So that is where those interest rates have come from.']\n",
      "[\"It is not just the tax cuts and it is not just the GST; it is also the deterioration in the budget position that derives from lax control over spending, underestimation of spending and the issues that I referred to previously. It is worth taking a look at two or three issues that have emerged in recent times with respect to government fiscal management. There are a couple that I have been involved in and I think they are fairly instructive. The first is the fiasco that has emerged with respect to the Job Network, particularly the government's own jobs provider, Employment National. Since Employment National's creation  in 1997, the government has injected roughly $47 million in capital into it. In the 1998-99 financial year, the last completed financial year, Employment National made a profit of $82 million before tax and abnormals. It paid tax of about $27 million. It paid a dividend to the government of about $8 million, and it returned $40 million to the government by way of a buyback of shares.\"]\n",
      "[\"A little while ago the former board, which was peremptorily sacked by the Minister for Finance and Administration in December, valued Employment National at roughly $380 million. So, from any perspective, Employment National could be seen, at least in a fiscal sense, to have been performing quite well. What subsequently happened, of course, is that, as well as Employment National being denied contracts in the second Job Network tender round—allegedly on the basis of poor performance but still with no evidence put forward by the government to justify this claimwhich is bad enough, the government's recently imposed new board, consisting primarily of public servants and therefore effectively taking direction from the relevant ministers, made a decision in mid-January to hand back all of the existing contracts that Employment National held. That meant that the contracts let to Employment National in Job Network one, which included almost 50 per cent of the total of intensive assistance contracts—the ones that are the most lucrative and involve the most workwere handed back midstream before they had been completed, and in some cases before they had even been entered into, because Job Network 1 remains open until 28 February. Anybody who signs on for assistance up to 28 February is still signing on under the first tender round. The government forced Employment National to hand these contracts back. It is no surprise therefore that we have seen dozens of Employment National offices close down in rural Australia. Why? Not because they missed out on contracts in the second Job Network tender aroundalthough, that clearly would have an effect anyway, at least down the trackbut because they were forced to hand back all of their existing contracts under the first Job Network tender round. This is literally wanton fiscal vandalism. It is destruction of value in a government business enterprise, valued at several hundred million dollars. The government has set out to destroy its own organisation, thereby destroying a very substantial amount of value in that organisation, which, of course, is a taxpayer-owned asset. This is the government cannibalising its own assets; this is the government cannibalising its own balance sheet.  \"]\n",
      "[\"The second issue which is indicative of the weaknesses in the government's fiscal management is its approach to the sale of Commonwealth government property, which is based on a 1996 set of Commonwealth property principles. Under these principles, the government will own propertyland, buildings and the likeonly where the long-term yield rate exceeds a 15 per cent rate of return or where it is in the public interest to do so. So clearly, one would assume, the government is not about to sell off Capital Hill and Parliament House and lease them back; although, given the attitude of this government, you could never be sure. The important point about this 15 per cent rate of return is that it is artificially high; therefore it is almost impossible for any particular government body to meet it. Built into this is an assumption that rentals will continue to be at the same level for the indefinite future, because the net effect of a decision now about owning or not owning property is to put yourself in a position with respect to certain obligations financially down the track. If you decide to rent now, rather than own, you are undertaking an obligation to pay rentbe it the building you are now renting or another buildingat some point in the future. The government has effectively taken a short-term gain with a serious risk of long-term paina classic example of a government in fiscal trouble. \"]\n",
      "[\"We are now seeing this situation spreading to organisations like the CSIRO. The government is proposing to sell things like the animal health laboratory and lease them back, so the CSIRO will continue to perform the same functions in the same facilities as it previously did. The serious risk is that the CSIRO will effectively have an additional charge on its budget as a result of the rental costs that will be undertaken. What the government is doing is taking the benefit of the value of the ownership away from the CSIRO and saying, `You are now renting.' It will be underresourcing the CSIRO and getting a disguised budget cut for the CSIRO. I will be pleased if that is not the case, but I have no doubt that the net effect of these decisions will be to put a further squeeze on the budget for the CSIRO and to put the government in a position, all around the country, where it is gambling on the future pattern of rental for the sorts of facilities that it is using. \"]\n",
      "['Clearly, you do not want the government owning every building that it is operating, and you do need some flexibility. It has to be said that the previous Labor government started the process of moving the Commonwealth away from owning lots of buildings and lots of premises. That was reasonable, and it is not unreasonable to have an appropriate balance between rented premises and owned premises, because there are needs for flexibility. Government departments shrink and growthere are a variety of factors involved. In overall terms, this government is taking it too far and creating a very substantial financial risk for the Commonwealth, which could mean that in the long term there is a net negative for the budget, even though there are short-term benefits.']\n",
      "[\"The third issue, which I mentioned briefly before but it is worth referring to it quickly, is of course the $2.2 billion that has been lavished on the private health insurance industry by this government in order to achieve a very modest increase in the number of Australians using private health insurance. That $2.2 billionand that is an annual figureis enough to pay for full private health insurance for 1.8 million Australians, and it is enough to staff 16 public hospitals. That really is public policy gone mad. It is a grossly inefficient use of scarce public resources, getting minimal positive outcomes for public health with maximum outlay of taxpayers' money.\"]\n",
      "[\"Finally, I want to turn to the issue that is dealt with in the second reading amendment that stands in my name, and that is the issue of specific purpose payments. The tax package that comes into effect in July of this year has at its core the concept of the revenue from the GST being handed over to the states. That is done in lieu of the previous financial assistance grants or general grants to the states. Clearly, what is intended, and what will happen over time, is that this transfer of Commonwealth revenue to the states will put increasing pressure on specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth to the states. The result will be that, under the Howard government, you will see a reduction in specific purpose payments for things like Medicare, public hospitals, schools, and Commonwealth-state housing agreements. There is no doubt that they will be eroded over time, possibly quite quickly, and there is no doubt that that was built into the agreement. It also means that Commonwealth fiscal flexibilitythe ability to vary taxation rates, spending and the like in order to fit with economic circumstances, to pump up the economy during a recession, or to restrain the economy when it is starting to overheat—is being eroded by this package. It particularly reduces the Commonwealth's ability to give financial and policy leadership to the big national issues of health, education and the future of our skills baseour human capital in Australia. It substantially erodes the ability of the Commonwealth to create and deliver a national agenda for the health, the education and the housing of the Australian people. \"]\n",
      "['Again, that is no coincidence. The intergovernmental agreement, at clause 5(v) says:']\n",
      "['The Commonwealth will continue to provide Specific Purpose Payments (SPPs) to the States and Territories and has no intention of cutting aggregate SPPs as part of the reform process set out in this agreement. ']\n",
      "[\"Yet on Friday of last week, on 3AW in Melbourne, we heard a slightly different story from the Prime Minister—that specific purpose payments will in fact be cut, because of the GST. The Prime Minister said, `We're providing less dollars, but because the costs of operating will fall, the real financial position will be the same.' In other words, the GST package is already a Trojan Horse for the reduction of specific purpose payments via dodgy calculations about the indirect effects of the tax package on the cost base of the states. And there is no doubt that the states, under pressure from the Commonwealth, will be forced to cop reductions in specific purpose payments, and all the pretence about maintaining SPPs will be abandoned at some point in the near future. \"]\n",
      "['The overall picture is that of a budget that is deteriorating. The tax cuts to sweeten the GST substantially favour higher income earners, and that will provide a boost to discretionary spending at a time when consumer debt is running away rapidly and when there is a serious risk of the economy overheating. Inevitably there will be a reduction in specific purpose payments and national investment as well as a reduction in national guidance and national leadership on the big picture national issues of health, education and simular issues.']\n",
      "[\"We have already seen the government's refusal to abide by the independent arbitration process with respect to the Medicare agreement, which can perhaps be seen as a first step towards the ultimate destruction of specific purpose payments. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement will soon come under attack. This is an issue of great concern to me because of the very large number of public tenants in my electorate. We will soon see funding of schools reduced. In a whole range of other issues, national leadershipthe setting of a national agenda of standards and effort and commitment to ensure that people get a decent education, decent health and other serviceswill be substantially eroded. I move:\"]\n",
      "['This amendment condemns the government for abdicating Commonwealth responsibility in the areas of health, education and like services and condemns the statements of the Prime Minister with respect to specific purpose payments. It condemns the government for failing to abide by the independent arbitration process with respect to the indexation of payments under the Australian Health Care Agreement, or the Medicare agreement as it is still popularly known. ']\n",
      "[\"In conclusion, the broad approach of the government is clear, and it shows through in these appropriation bills. We see a pattern, particularly in 1996-97, of enormous cuts to health, education, child care and other services. It is an attempt to shift the tax burden onto lower income earners and to reduce the tax burden on higher income earners in this country. Big tax cuts are a part of that process, which incidentally are being delivered at a time when the economy can least afford a substantial increase in discretionary spending power. All of this is wrapped up in incompetent administration of Commonwealth finances. We are seeing a massively poor estimation of expensesguesstimates that have turned out to be wildly wrongon a range of issues. There has been a very severe deterioration in the Commonwealth's budgetary position. To be fair, the fiscal position has become more fragile because of factors that none of us could have predicted, such as the East Timor situation. The government has now got itself into a position where its fiscal position is extremely susceptible to going south if we have a significant economic downturn, or the United States stock market goes backwards in a big way or for a variety of other factors, such as substantial further increases in the oil price, thereby pumping up inflation again.\"]\n",
      "['There is an endless array of factors that can be listed as threats to the Australian economy.

There is every chance that we will have to meet those threats in the very near future. ']\n",

How did they bring about this situation which threatened the future of Australia? They ran up budget deficits totalling almost $70 billion in their last five years in government. Commonwealth government net debt rose from $16.9 billion in 1991 to $95.8 billion in 1995-96. Business interest rates went to more than 20 per cent in 1989. The standard of living compared with other developed countries fell, and between 1983 and 1995 Australia's per capita income dropped from 14th position in the world down to 19th position.

Successive Labor governments had continued to build up the bankcard debt. Successive Labor governments thought that it was socially and economically responsible and acceptable to spend more in each year than they earned. The 1999-2000 budget delivered the third surplus in a row, with a surplus of $5.4 billion expected, although that might be impacted somewhat by the Timor events.

Inflation has averaged around one per cent per annum and is now at levels comparable with the early 1960s. Low inflation delivers low interest rates and a more stable environment for business that encourages productive investment, and productive investment brings about more jobs. Low interest rates are stimulating the economy and producing big savings for home buyers. Variable home loan mortgage rates have come down from 10.5 per cent at the time of the 1996 election.

Let us look at the overall benefits of this new tax system. The Labor Party like to concentrate on the GST and they like to find anomalies which, in reality, do not exist. But let us look at the big picture and the very many benefits which will flow through to not only the Sunshine Coast but also other parts of regional Australia and, indeed, to the nation as a whole. The coalition is bringing about a $12 billion cut in personal income tax. This is the largest personal income tax cut in Australian history. It will mean that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will have a marginal tax rate no higher than 30 cents in the dollar.

There will be a more internationally competitive system of business tax, including a reduced company tax rate, a significantly lower capital gains tax rate, a range of initiatives and incentives for small business and a more realistic basis for the future provision of important government services, such as schools, public hospitals, police and roads, by providing that all of the revenue from the GST will be passed on to the states and territories which are responsible for those services. \"]\n",

The Labor Party also seek to make certain criticisms in relation to the health care agreement. I just want to reiterate that, as part of the new tax system, all of the GST revenue will be passed through to the states. One of the disadvantages of our federal system since the time of the Second World War is that the states did not have the revenue base to deliver the services which are their constitutional responsibility. This is the first government to really bring about a return to Federation as it was originally understood. For the first time in living memory, the states of Australia will be given the opportunity to carry out their constitutional function. They will be given the money. They will be given the cash. They will be given the financial ability to deliver on their responsibilities under the Australian Constitution. Of course you need a reduction in specific purpose payments and there will be a removal of Commonwealth funding of some health, education and community services, because we are passing the revenue through to the states and they will be able to carry out their functions under the Constitution as was originally envisaged by Australia's founding fathers. \"]\n",

Let us look at the fact that the Morgan and Banks quarterly jobs index, released only today for the period from February to April 2000, showed strong business confidence in preparedness for the new tax system. This is not a mickey mouse or a false survey; this is a real survey, a professional assessment of where business stands. Right across Australia, as you would be interested to know, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, 3,200 businesses were surveyed regarding tax reform.

We are already seeing the beginning of this new policy in the way the government has reneged on its commitments under the Australian health care agreements for grants to the states for public hospitals.

The government knew what it was signing and, in particular through the Minister for Health and Aged Care, has always claimed that it would deliver the money it said it wouldthat is, about $5.9 billion would be paid under these agreements this year, accounting for about half the cost of running the states' public health systems.

In addition, by 2003 there will have been 10 years of inflation, vast changes in medical technology and the introduction of many new drugs. The age profile of the community has also changed significantly.

The reality is that negotiations over the Australian health care agreements left the states several hundred million dollars short of what is required to continue to deliver services to a growing population.

The Commonwealth has reneged on the agreements it entered into just 18 months ago. The original agreements provided for indexation of the grants to accommodate growing populations, an increase in demand on hospitals due to the ageing population and greater utilisation, and an increase in the costs of actually running hospitals. The basis for this third set of factors was not agreed prior to signing the Australian health care agreements. Instead, a process was specified for the states and the Commonwealth to negotiate on how the indexation of the grants for inflation in medical costs would occur. Last year, the Commonwealth adopted a hardline position and refused to grant the states any more than the 0.5 per cent default increase provided for in the agreements, to apply whilst negotiations occurred. This compared to the ordinary consumer price index of 1.75 per cent for the year to last March, which was less than the actual increase in costs experienced by hospitals for wages and materials. The inflation in medical costs is well documented as exceeding the ordinary consumer price index for a range of reasons, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics prepares specialist indices to measure cost movements in the health sector.']\n",

Fortunately, under the agreement there was a provision for the appointment of an independent expert arbiter to determine the actual rate of indexation in case such a situation occurred. I say `fortunately', but as it has turned out, even though this expert arbiter was appointed, the minister has completely refused to take his advice. This clause was intended to prevent any deadlock by binding both parties to any dispute. But, as I have just remarked, the Commonwealth abused the process and has refused to accept the outcome. The states wrote to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on 26 May last year. They specifically asked him to make a commitment to the process and invited him to nominate the arbiterin a small way trying to get him to own the process. They were obviously well aware of the possibility that the minister would welsh on the deal. \"]\n",

We will see, as my remarks go on, that this was a very significant change.']\n",
      "['The arbiter duly called for submissions and reported on the due date of 31 October. He analysed the problem in great technical detail and considered all the arguments presented to him. He concluded that the Commonwealth was wrong in the views it expressed, and he made a clear recommendation that the best and most appropriate form of indexation was to increase the payments under the Australian health care agreements by the consumer price index plus 0.5 per cent. In the case of the 1999-2000 payments, this required an average national indexation of 2.25 per cent, based on the previous March quarter CPI figures.']\n",
      "[\"But the Commonwealth refused to accept the umpire's decision. Two days before Christmas, when the minister knew he would get minimum scrutiny, the minister rejected the arbiter's report and announced he would unilaterally impose an outcome based on an average one per cent increase for the states. This left the states about $100 million a year worse off compared to the arbiter's recommendation of a 2.25 per cent increase. So in one stroke of this minister's pen, the Howard government sliced the equivalent of a major teaching hospital budget off their contribution to our public hospitals.\"]\n",

The minister does not even bother to try to show that there has been any reduction in public waiting times as a result of the health rebate, because there has not been. On the one hand there is money pouring into subsidising the private sector, with no effect at all on the public hospital waiting lists, yet at the same time as that is happening the states are being cut back to the tune of $100 million in this year alone. ']\n",
      "[\"The $100 million lost to public hospitals as a result of this Scrooge-like Christmas present from the health minister is only the start of the problem. The funding deficit will grow and compound over the four years of the current agreements. Each year the gap will expand between the default indexation which the government has built into the forward estimates and the actual funding requirement of public hospitals simply to treat their current patients. In this bill, which gives effect to the amounts set out in the additional estimates, this government has allocated just $30.2 million to pay for the increase from the original default indexation and the minister's Christmas announcement. This is just a fraction of the money that was required, and the states are left $100 million underfunded. That is just for one year. It is $100 million they are owed by the Commonwealth as a result of recommendations from an independent arbiter. The choice the states are left with is to cut services even further than they have already been in recent years, or to find more state funds to prop up their hospitals and keep the doors open. And that is what is at the heart of this government's funding strategy. Once again the member for Herbert says, `Oh, go to the states.' That is exactly what is at the heart of this government's strategy: to maximise the pressure on the states to take up funding responsibility for health. The Prime Minister, as we heard on Friday on 3AW, let the cat out of the bag. He wants to backslide in specific purpose payments and commitments such as the Australian health care agreements and force the states to fund health and education through GST receipts. He has now made it very clear that that is what his plan is.  \"]\n",
      "['As the states know, and the hospitals in particular, this will not be the only impact the GST will have on hospital funding and their ability to deliver services. We have heard at length from hospital operators who fear the bureaucratic nightmare they face under the GST to track the separate costs they incur between those which attract the GST and those which do not so that they can later recover a portion of their budget. It is interesting also to look at what Mr Castles, the independent arbiter, concluded in this area, because he identified a further degree of complication that will arise because of the GST. Agreement has not been reached on the basis for indexing the Australian health care agreements in 2000-01 because no-one is sure of what the impact of the GST will be on the consumer price index and how relevant this measure will be to the movement in hospital running costs. Mr Castles concluded that it would be necessary to conduct a further inquiry into the impact of the GST on the cost of providing public hospital services and the CPI to determine what other ad hoc adjustments would be required to compensate hospitals for unintended consequences flowing from the impact of the GST on the consumer price index. Not unexpectedly, the minister once again dismissed this recommendation and said he would decide what adjustments to make. In other words, once again the states will be starved of funds by being denied the true cost of the GST, and the minister is not prepared to allow an independent expert to determine what they are really entitled to. ']\n",
      "['The only losers from this process are the vast bulk of the public who depend on our public hospital system. As a one-eyed supporter of private health, the minister pays little regard to this problem. However, he should not forget, and all the members of the government should not forget, that 70 per cent of the Australian population depend solely on the public system. We should also not forget that those with private health insurance, whose interests the minister is preoccupied with, also rely heavily on the public system. If you have private health insurance and have a major car accident, you are going to end up in the emergency ward of a major public teaching hospital. But that is not the concern of this government. They just want to palm the responsibility for that back onto the states and cut the specific purpose payments on the way through. ']\n",

In both cases, this is money that is desperately needed to make sure that our public hospitals are able to continue to do the job that they do so well, which is caring for patients and caring for those people who need the services that they deliver. It is an absolute outrage that these services, some of the most important services that we have in our community, are being so dramatically attacked by this government, whether it is in the government's decision to cut funding when the GST comes in or whether it is a result of this minister's decision to not meet the recommendations of an independent arbiter to make sure that hospitals have the funds that they need so that patients get properly treated.

We have about 10,500 students enrolled this year, 80 per cent of those in Townsville and 20 per cent in the Cairns campus. It was a good year last year and we are looking forward to an even better year this year. Every year the Graduate Careers Council of Australia sends a questionnaire to every graduating Australian university student seeking their opinions on the quality of the teaching they receive. There are 37 universities in Australia and you might like to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that last year JCU was ranked fourth or fifth in Australia, above many of the sandstone universities. That is a great achievement for a regional university, particularly a university so far away in Northern Australia.']\n",

Across Australia, about 55 per cent of those attending university are womenof course, only 45 per cent are men. At James Cook the disparity is even greater: 62 per cent are women and only 38 per cent are males. This is the fifth highest imbalance in Australia. The vice-chancellor has said that he fears that this imbalance will have a long-term derogatory effect on the employment prospects of males and on the social fabric of that region. This is the view of the Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University. He also goes on to say that it looks as though the male problem begins at school, probably as early as year 10. More boys than girls leave at year 10 and so the message has been of critical importance to education, to the whole of life, that you need to get to these students very early on in the piece. ']\n",

Average starting salaries for male graduates are about 19 per cent higher than for non-graduates and about 15 per cent higher for women. Average salaries for graduates double within five years of graduating, and for non-graduates that is about 40 per cent. The proportion of degree holders in the work force has increased from 10 per cent in 1989 to 17 per cent in 1997. The degree is increasingly an entry level qualification for many jobs. People with a degree are 2.5 times less likely to be unemployed than those who completed their education at year 12.

Certainly I have been very strongly advocating that this road be constructed as part of the new ring-road bypass of Townsville and therefore part of the national highway.

He wrote a letter to the local Townsville Bulletin and indicated that, as far as he was concerned, the Commonwealth should fund the lot. My message to the minister is: that is not the real world. If you want the federal government to bring on this development prematurely, then we have to see the colour of your money. I think it is entirely reasonable, and I think that the people of Townsville and Thuringowa would think it entirely reasonable, that there be a fifty-fifty cost arrangement. If we can agree on that, I will go in to bat. I will get to John Anderson. I understand that road funding is tight, but I will get to John Anderson.']\n",
      "[\"I would like to talk about another matter—the current daily scare campaign in relation to the GST. Let me tell you what happened last week in Townsville. I turned on the television and here was one of the local Labor Party candidates for the local government election running on the GST. It was nothing to do with local issues; it was just the standard fear and scare campaign. Do you know what he was saying, Mr Deputy Speaker? He was saying on the television to all of the people of Townsville and Thuringowa that the price of petrol was going to go to over $l a litre because of the GST. I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing, so I rang him up. It was Les Walker, the candidate for division 7. I said, `Les, where did you get this particular information from? You know the government has given a commitment that the price of petrol will not rise due to the GST. That has been spelt out over and over again.' Do you know what Les's response to me was? He said, `Well, Pete, you have to take every opportunity you can get.'\"]\n",
      "[\"What he was saying was to hell with truth; it does not matter. If you can get out there on the television, the television grab is more important than the truth. It is sad that in this country, when we all know we need a new and fair tax system, a Labor city councillor candidate will get on the television and unashamedly say, `The price of petrol is going to go up over $1 due to the GST.' It is very sad indeed, and it is an indictment of our process that that kind of thing can go ahead. But why should I have been surprised? At the last election I saw the Labor candidate on television saying, in every television commercial break, that everything was going up by 10 per cent. \"]\n",
      "['Another matter affecting the north is the absolute importance of the Chevron gas pipeline proposal, which the government has given major project facilitation for.']\n",
      "[\"I have seen a report generated by Townsville Enterprise, which was written by Energy North Queensland and the AEC group. Such a measure would bring $6 billion in related industrial development to the north. That is the kind of impact that this gas pipeline would have. It would increase the gross state product by $3.2 billion. It has massive positive ramifications for North Queensland and that is terrific. We must do everything that we can to facilitate that project. Currently, as I understand it, we are in the hands of Exxon and Chevron as they discuss getting extra gas supplies from New Guinea. Once that is put in place, away we go. Once we get that agreement and the green light from Chevron, it is time to say to the state government, `No more coal-fired power stations.' The member for Banks would agree with me: he would support that proposition. He would understand how damaging coal-fired power stations are to our environment. It is very important that we change to a much cleaner-burning fuel, which is the gas supply. There are some big benefits for Australia in this, as well as big benefits for our local region.\"]\n",
      "[\"Finally, I turn to the Queensland nickel refinery at Yabulu, also in Townsville. We now have three major metal refineries. We have the nickel refinery, the copper refinery and the Sun Metals zinc refinery. These major refining processes are in Townsville. I was very privileged late last year to attend what was a world significant event at the Queensland nickel refinery. QNR are a model innovator. Their ore supply, which was sourced locally at Greenvale, ran out and now they are able to import ore from Indonesia, the Philippines and New Caledonia, process it and re-export it, and do it profitably. They are doing very well indeed, and that is in the face of low metal prices. In the face of that, they are the first nickel producing operation in the world to gain ISO 14001 certification. That is a marvellous achievement and it is occurring in Townsville, just as so many other world leading processes are in Townsville. Townsville is Australia's largest tropical city. Some people would nominate Cairns; some people would nominate Darwin.\"]\n",

      "[\"In addressing the amendment moved by the opposition, I would like to concentrate on the issue of higher education and the concerns I have with the government's disastrous handling of this vital aspect of Australia's future. In my electorate of Swan there exists a forward looking and proud educational institution, Curtin University. It is one of the most prominent institutions in the country, with total capital accumulation and reserves of about $350 million and total enrolments of over 25,000 for this year. The reason I am concerned is the long-term prospects that this and other institutions face under this government.\"]\n",
      "['A closer examination of Curtin enrolments and finances reveals a distressing picture, a picture echoed across the education community in the nation. I note that there has been a decline in postgraduate enrolments due to the introduction of fees and the cessation of HECS coverage for these courses. In fact, the number of fee-paying students has increased by 900 per cent at Curtin since 1997. Students are paying a higher proportion of the funding for the sector when compared with the proportion of federal government funds. In fact, nationally they have contributed about $1.5 billion, which is roughly the size of the reduction in federal funding. Class sizes and student ratios for the majority of courses have increased by up to 30 per cent over the last four years. The building of libraries and the purchase of books and equipment has been reduced to constrained budgets thereby jeopardising better education. There is an increasingly large proportion of students who will have to take out student loans and/or defer due to financial reasons. According to Curtin University, academic placements have declined by five per cent compared with enrolments. ']\n",
      "['Let us not lose sight of the fact that education is important, and it is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, obviously, it develops the potential within our youth to provide our society with skilled citizens thereby enabling us to develop and maintain an effective and functional society. Secondly, education gives our citizens the capacity to retrain and continuously re-evaluate their contribution, both personally and functionally, to society. Thirdly, education plays an important part in the socialisation process. It matures the individual and makes them recognise their role and the role we all play in a cultivated and progressive society. We on this side of the House recognise the importance of education, unlike many of those within the government. In practice, this is the mute education government. It is a government where only the wealthy will be able to afford education. In fact, it is happening now. Only the privileged few have access to many courses, especially at a postgraduate level. ']\n",
      "[\"This government simply ignores the fact that the role of higher education has never been as important as it is today. Not long ago, UNESCO held the World Conference on Higher Education. That conference was attended by more than 3,000 delegates, including 115 education ministers and legislators, scholars, students and officials from around 180 countries. At the keynote address, the Director-General of UNESCO called for a major increase in the availability of higher education and lifelong learning. The Director-General indicated that a `radical transformation of the higher education landscape' was needed. To this end, the conference backed a world declaration on higher education for the 21st century. The declaration endorsed the right of access to higher education based on personal merit. This relates to article 26.1 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.\"]\n",
      "[\"In Australia, by contrast, commitment of the Commonwealth to public funding of higher education has never been so weak. The government funding under the `minister for shorter term and servility' reflects the total abrogation by this government of its responsibility to ensure a quality, accessible and accountable public higher education system. This government has left a terrible legacy to the higher education sector. Since the election of the first Howard government in 1996, we have known that the notion of education as an investment was in serious jeopardy. Those sceptics about the Howard government's education policies were to have their views justified in the very first budget that removed the better part of $1.9 billion from the sector. This was closely followed by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1998 that set maximum operating grants for universities in 1999 and 2000, thereby confirming in legislation for the first time the government's massive cuts to the university operating grants which were announced in 1996.\"]\n",
      "['At a time when our competitors overseas have introduced new technologies to industry, when information technology capacity doubles every 18 months and the prices halve every 12 months, we gained a true insight into this visionary lot opposite by their inability to discuss education policy during the election campaign. In fact, the policy platform was so unremarkable that it was released one evening in such a manner as to avoid scrutiny. In its recent analysis of the Australian educational scene, the Australian newspaper said:']\n",
      "['This government has failed to realise that a robust educational system is the backbone for economic success. Investment in the human capital of the nation contributes much more to solving the unemployment problem than cutting wages and slashing social security. We have a government that claims its program for the second term is labour market flexibility, yet it fails to realise the limitations of labour reform. You can slash social security and lower wages to poverty levels, but the underlying fact remains that if the people do not have the skills necessary for employment then they will not find a job. It is ultimately education that allows flexibility in the labour market. It is a hypocritical government that talks about labour flexibility but fails to provide people with the flexible array of skills and training that will help them in the transition of jobs.']\n",
      "[\"Those opposite also fail to realise that our nation's advantage lies in the field of education and its many industries. We will never be able to beat those factory fodder nations who pay their workers $2 a day. It comes as no surprise to the chamber that the government have rejected the opportunity to achieve excellence in education. These are the people who are responsible for the 10 per cent GST lumped on students who, like many Australians, do not earn a substantial income. It is essentially a tax on education and a tax on the nation's future potential.\"]\n",
      "['Students have also been hit hard by the abysmal voluntary student unionism, which has seen the complete collapse of many student guilds which make representations for the welfare of students. We have seen a reduction in the capacity of our education sector to provide high quality, broad based education to the Australian people and a greater emphasis within the universities on commercialisation. Unfortunately, the constriction of the focus of our university sector has impacted on every aspect of university life and has resulted in inferior quality of education in our universities.']\n",
      "[\"Also, let us not forget the plight of those employed in the education sector. Under this government, there has been a shift whereby there is an overriding atmosphere of fear and intimidation, where academics are stifled, morale has plummeted and controversy is feared. According to Don DeBats and Alan Ward's book Degrees of Difference, funding cuts are hurting institutions around the country. Staff numbers have also been slashed and the government still refuses to honour its pledge to honour the ongoing staff wage claim. Security of tenure in Australian universities is no longer a meaningful notion. Yet this government continues to peddle the myth that our universities are prospering. I discard this fable, as do students and staff coping with funding cuts. The more market driven approach adopted by the government has supplanted the nature and role of academics. Our academics are no longer encouraged to espouse views and positions which in the past were the essence of debate in public life.\"]\n",
      "[\"For Australia's 600,000 students, the decline in quality has been most evident in the decline in courses and subject options. And we have seen the rapid escalation in fees. Who would have thought a few years ago that there would be some 21,000 fewer fully funded Commonwealth places? This government has sought to force upon universities a proposition which involves the charging of fees of up to $80,000 for courses. We have seen a decline in quality in the choices evident in certain faculties. This has seen students being forced to absorb $800 million worth of budget cuts. Staff-student ratios have risen in the 1990s, from 16.5 to 18.5 in students in the humanities and from 18 to 20 in the social sciences. Faculties have closed and various language programs are disappearing. I am informed that seven arts faculties across the country have ceased to exist.\"]\n",
      "[\"Unfortunately, most universities have been forced into accepting market driven criteria for their operations. At a lecture series in Melbourne in August 1998, Barry Jones highlighted the failure of Australia's universities to fight for the traditional values of scholarship or to contribute to debates on controversial issues. This has meant that the government can attack them with impunity. According to Barry Jones, the various vice-chancellors, rather than defend the actions of researchers in their universities, at the time principally acquiesced to maintaining silence in regard to the onslaughts of these philistine elements within the conservative political parties. What followed was that various elements of the bureaucracy itself understood that university administrations were not capable of showing the strength and resolution to defend the academic freedom that they so often asserted was their due. In practice, they maintained a silence and were thought to be acquiescing to government attacks, thinking that those attacks would lessen in their brutality. \"]\n",
      "['The federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp, appears to share this view. The grand traditions of Australian universities are now directly under attack by this government. The decline in the emphasis and the quality of provision impact most strongly throughout university administrations, which have suffered the constant burden of finding new ways to get funds and developing new strategies to get around guidelines, shifting their focus from education to the more narrow commercial focuses that the government is seeking to pursue. In the election period the government claimed that it was about breadth of provision, but in reality we have seen a whole series of bills dealing with higher education. We are now dealing with a funding base for the next three years, with bills being introduced with very little public debate and in such a manner and with such time pressures as to prevent proper scrutiny of what is being proposed.']\n",
      "[\"We have also seen various surveys and empirical research emerging from the universities, indicating that there is a growing problem in the way universities are seeking to get around government regulations and guidelines in the provisions of this government's recent legislation. In getting around the contractions, they have had to levy other charges. Students are being charged for such things as email access from home and access to assignment questions exclusively available from the email, and there have reportedly been requirements for internal students to purchase course materials designed for external study. These levies substitute for cuts in staffing resources that are no longer available. Students have also been charged increased HECS and up-front fees. This makes our students pay the highest tuition fees in our history. Whatever the minister may think of the National Union of Students or the National Tertiary Education Union, they are the only organisations that can highlight to the community the problems on this issue.\"]\n",
      "[\"Students have always been expected to pay some photocopying, stationery and textbook costs—things that they individually benefit from or keep for their professional development and careers. As the frequency of ancillary fees increases, more students are finding it increasingly difficult to meet these additional costs. I understand that the National Union of Students actually conducted a survey on the types of ancillary charges now applying in many of our universities. The survey found that institutions were charging for services that should be considered a normal component of a student's tuition fee. It may seem a distant memory for many of us, but the days when a faculty could afford to provide services for students have disappeared. Furthermore, as a result of cost cutting, 59 per cent of institutions charge students for access to the Internet via the university or from home, and four per cent already charge for email access on campus. Of course, it is quite standard that many lecturers demand that students submit their work in word processor formats. This clearly creates barriers for those students who are less well off and cannot hope to compete with their well-heeled friends. Add to this the scarcity of computer pools on campus, particularly as funding cuts begin to bite harder, and you are applying enormous financial and time pressure on these students. University life entails much more than just research and analysis. It is a networking experience that should be available to everybody. It should not be limited to the born-to-rule mob. In fact, they are least in need of the platform of education. For many in our society, university is indeed the biggest opportunity for achievement. \"]\n",
      "[\"As stated previously, students must also deal with the issue of up-front fees. These are a psychological and financial disincentive to enter into and pursue higher education. Not only that, I believe in a livable income for students. I believe in financial support in the form of Austudy and Abstudy. This is another lost opportunity by this government to ensure that students, especially those from lower income households and disadvantaged backgrounds, have an opportunity to pursue education and training in a way that does not add to the financial and other pressures on their family members. Another element of all the funding reductions is the strategies that institutions have had to embrace in order to make ends meet. We are seeing questionable practices used to drive the performance indicators that DETYA is currently developing. They are meant to examine university finances, deployment of staff, diversity of courses and the various student outcomes, but they all seem to be totally inadequate because, on the government's own admission, interpretation of these indicators is difficult as accounting conventions vary from university to university. Specifically, universities are making internal decisions regarding the centralisation or devolution of administrative functions to hide the true nature of their cost structures. This is an attempt by the universities to cope with the growing crisis that is emerging in our higher education sector—a crisis of confidence that goes to the very issues of the provision of quality education in this country. You cannot possibly have the cuts imposed on universities and not expect them to have an effect on the quality of services provided.  \"]\n",
      "[\"Funding cuts over the last three years have had a dramatic impact on the education system. In 1997 funding was reduced by one per cent. In 1998 the amount was reduced by a further three per cent, with another one per cent cut to university operating grants in 1999 and a further one per cent in the year 2000. The government hypocritically looks the nation in the eye and says that it wants to create a `can do' nation. It also boasts the myth that higher education spending increased in the 1999 budget. One only has to look at the previous budgets to expose this political fib. In these budgets, the government wiped out much more than was put back in this year. Worse still is its defence that these budgets were in some way economically responsible. However, the irresponsibility of these budgets and their failure to allow funds for investing in the future reflects the government's bankrupt approach to education and its role in solving economic problems.\"]\n",
      "['As is so often the case with the coalition, their government has resorted to bandaid solutions for retraining and the provision of skills. This failure is essentially a problem of leadership. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has decided that the long-term focus of education is too difficult an issue to deal with in the context of three-year electoral terms. The ALP has a belief that education not only plays a vital part in getting Australia to the forefront of a technical and productive world but also is a vital part of achieving an enlightened and democratic society. Education also ensures that people have better employment opportunities and prospects.']\n",
      "[\"I view the decline in public funding for education as a disaster.

Already, Victorians are starting to rue the day they threw out Jeff Kennett and replaced a strong government with strong financial strategies that were bringing jobs and prosperity to Victoria.

It now seems that those power restrictions in fact may not even have been necessary. They have already had a general building strike. They have had the failure of the $485 million studio city development at Docklands, and I understand that Mirvac has postponed a $1 billion apartment plan and that the MAV Corporation now says that its $900 million new key precinct project could also be in doubt.']\n",

Productivity grew by 2.4 per cent through the year to June 1999. Over the same period in 1995, productivity in Australia fell by 0.2 per cent. Over the year to the June quarter in 1999, real wages grew by 3.7 per cent. Over the same period in 1995, real wages growth was zero, absolutely nothing, under the Labor government. In the year to November 1995 the unemployment rate was a massive 8.5 per cent, coming off an unbelievable peak of 11.2 per cent.

Even today, at 7.3 per cent, there is a saving of approximately $266 per month on the average mortgage.

Australia was the only country in the Asia-Pacific region to escape the decimation of the Asian economic crisis.

All of these would have helped to erode our high standard of living and, in turn, could have destroyed many dreams that Australians have had over the last many years.

To apply, neither person can have owned a home before. People will be eligible if they are buying or building their first home, are an Australian citizen or a permanent resident, intend to make the home their principal residence, and start living in that home within a reasonable time. The payment will be made regardless of income, and it will be the same regardless of the area in which people are buying or the value of the home.

They showed one town where you could buy seven homes for the same price you would pay for a flat on the North Shore of Sydney. So you can see that people in rural and regional Australia who may be trying to purchase a home for $50,000 or $60,000 will have the same access to that $7,000a very significant amount towards helping them make that startas people in the city.

We are now seeing some of the lowest interest rates that we have seen in Australia in living memoryafter all, it is still possible to get a home loan at around the six per cent or seven per cent mark. Most of us in this place remember the late 1980s, when we had home loan interest rates of something like 14 per cent to 16 per cent.

I saw them lose their homes and lose their dreams because of those interest rates and because of `the recession we had to have'.

It will be very much like the Y2K bug. The Labor Party will try to whip up a frenzy before 1 July.

      "[\"It is time for the Treasurer's fiscal reality check. Does the performance of the Howard-Costello government still match its claims of careful fiscal management, which it said was its priority when it came to office? In the 1996 budget, the Treasurer claimed that he would achieve about $8 billion in savings by the end of the third out year. That third out year is this financial year, so it is appropriate and, with the publication of the midyear review in November, now possible to get a good handle on what the Treasurer has achieved. For the purpose of this analysis, I have compiled a table of the policy decisions taken by the government from the summary measures tables contained in the Treasurer's own budget papers for 1996 to 1999 and from his midyear economic and fiscal outlook papers for each of those years. The table contains only 16 numbers. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.\"]\n",

The fact that that fiscal loosening is about to occur is well known, and I will reflect on whether it is wise to be making so substantial a change to the stance of policy at this time a little later. Before doing that, I want to examine what the figures I have presented say about the performance of the government and the Treasurer up until the new tax system comes into effect. There is no doubt that when it was elected the government took dramatic action on the fiscal front.\"]\n",
      "['The 1996 midyear review shows that the Treasurer kept a fairly tight rein on his colleagues at least for the rest of that year. There was an additional $600 million in additional spending after the budget, but the out year effects were contained at less than a third of that. The 1997 budget contained significant savings measures, but these were offset by new spending and tax cuts, with a small net contribution to the fiscal position in the third out year. However, the 1997 midyear review shows that the brakes were off and spending was starting to roll. New spending decisions totalling almost $400 million were taken but, by the third out year, they would cost more than three times that. 1998 was, of course, an election year. The budget contained some modest spending initiatives costing about $1.4 billion and some small cuts in taxes offset by politically cautious small savings and revenue measures. The effect of these decisions in the third out year was a further loosening in fiscal policy of about $2.2 billion. ']\n",
      "['The 1998 midyear review shows that, over the period between the May budget and the October election, there was a lot of additional spending, which turned a net $1.3 billion fiscal loosening into a net $2.1 billion loosening, rising to $3.2 billion in the financial year we are now in. The election also meant the now illusory $7 billion tax cut bribe to get the GST in or, more correctly, the government re-elected, but I will deal with that later. The 1998 budget again saw a loosening of the purse strings on spending—this time by about $1.2 billion. By the time the midyear review was published, that loosening had doubled to $2.4 billion. What is the sum total of this inexorable process of fiscal loosening even before the introduction of the GST? The Treasurer, by his fiscal laxity, has allowed all of the $8 billion worth of savings he achieved in his first budget to be wiped out. The net effect of all the policy decisions taken since the 1996 budget has been to dissipate the annual savings made in that budget. That has taken only a little over three years. It seemed that the Treasurer had contracted a case of fiscal fatigue after only 12 months.']\n",
      "[\"How has growth in the government's other outlaysthose that have grown other than as a consequence of policy decisionsbeen financed and how have surpluses been achieved? From three sources: the proceeds of asset sales, some of which have been explicitly hypothecated to expenditure; the proceeds of economic growth, both in terms of revenue growth and reduced outlays; and reductions in public debt interest on account of both reduced debt levels and lower interest rates. The last two of these are in fact cyclical phenomena. Governments, by good policy, can contribute to their being prolonged or perhaps not being shortened, but they are not in themselves necessarily a result of fiscal discipline. In the present situation I would say that they are masking some lack of fiscal discipline. \"]\n",
      "[\"There are some other signs of the present shortcomings of fiscal policy. The 1999-2000 budget papers show that Commonwealth underlying own purpose outlays, as a percentage of GDP, have risen from 20.5 per cent, their level as a result of Labor's last budget, to an estimated 21.4 per cent this financial year. Likewise, the table showing the percentage change in underlying outlays reveals that the Costello period of fiscal consolidation on the outlays side has been comparatively short. Contraction occurred only in 1997-98 of 1.7 per cent, the deferred effect of the 1996 budget measures. However, comparisons with subsequent years are meaningless due to the inclusion of accumulated public trading enterprise superannuation liabilities.\"]\n",

We should keep in mind, however, that of the six years of surplus there shown, only one is currently behind us. The 1999-2000 surplus we could take as being recently assured, but beyond that we are talking about mere projections, subject to all of the uncertainties of the world economy. Taking the 1999-2000 surplus as being `in the bag', the cumulative surplus over the three years would amount to 1.5 per cent of annual GDP. The scale of that might be assessed against the surpluses in the late 1980s, our last period of fiscal consolidation. \"]\n",

      "[\"My fear is that `a complacent attitude to the use of fiscal surpluses' is exactly what we are seeing with this dramatic loosening of fiscal policy provided by the Howard government's so-called new tax system. If fiscal policy is the correct instrument to control the current account, why is the government loosening fiscal policy when the current account deficit is already high? The answer is that the Treasurer is not focused on the risk. The government has been in a state of self-congratulation since its first two budgets, believing that all the hard work has been done. A long period of economic growth and low interest rates up till now and the proceeds of asset sales have masked the danger signals. No-one in the government seems to have noticed or cared that the hard won gains of their first two budgetsand they were hard won if you were among the millions of members of the Australian community who were forced to bear the consequences of those policy measureshave been allowed to run into the fiscal sand. Australians now face an uncertain future with a new tax, with the benefits shared as unequally as the consequences of the Treasurer's earlier fiscal policy. That tax policy also involves a loosening of fiscal policy that brings with it a substantial element of macro-economic risk. \"]\n",

Any man who put on the uniform of the army of the SS knew what he was doing. I do not think it is appropriate for a minister of Australia to say that he was simply the equivalent of any Australian citizen returning to this country. It is a deep reflection on Australia's very honourable record during the Second World War. I, like many Australians, cringed when we heard those comments that he was welcome in Australia.\"]\n",

First of all, it should be noted that in American and Canadian courtsand there were court hearings over his status it was proved, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Kalejs was, as he now admits, a member of an organisation known as the Arajs Kommando. In all of those court hearings, Mr Kalejs absolutely denied that he was involved with this group. The activities of the Arajs Kommandowith Viktor Arajs as their leaderneed no elaboration by me. Their record is infamous. Their murder of civilians in their tens of thousands is attested by history. Yet the Australian government did not seem to know, as the Australian archives now reveal, that Mr Kalejs had lied about his Australian citizenship when he came to this country. He claimed on his immigration records, as the front pages of the Border Morning Mail, the Australian and the Canberra Times all showed, to have been a farm labourer and university student during the Second World War, as he had claimed in the American and Canadian courts. What did he do on arriving here? For the first time in 50 years he admitted that he had been in this infamous Arajs Kommando. His picture appeared on the front page of the Telegraph. ']\n",

Yes, we believe in `innocent until proven guilty', but I have to remind the minister for justice of what that great Conservative Prime Minister of Britain stood for during the Second World War: anyone who served in this uniform would have plunged the world into another thousand years of darkness unless we had all opposed them.

I am sure that all of us feel a great deal of regret and sorrow over the death of any young people in Australia from suicide. But I want to speak on the broader issue tonight because our Constitution has given our states and territories the responsibility for making laws in regard to the issue of law and order. Australia is a very big country with vast regional differences, and the people in my state, Western Australia, have democratically elected the state government and called on that government to address a serious law and order issue of home burglary. In fact, Western Australia has the highest rate of reported home burglaries in Australia. It was as a result of the outcry by people of Western Australia that the Western Australian government took the measures that it did. Home burglary is a very serious offence, as it violates the sanctity of people's home and has a long-lasting effect which traumatises the victims, sometimes for many years after the event. It is not just the petty amount that is stolen but there are many women, older women in particular, who live alone and who are particularly traumatised by this kind of event. It is too prevalent in Western Australia. \"]\n",

To further suggest invoking an international treaty is also quite wrong in substance in this case. I understand fully the reason for international treaties, especially in terms of the rights of children, and there is no-one that has been more outspoken on the rights of children and the proper care and protection of children than I have been. But to suggest that a responsible state government, in a country that has a strong commitment to the rule of law and a decent system of justice, should be subjected to international law is again to treat Western Australian people very shabbily. In fact, the government has taken into consideration international law, and that law is put there to provide guidance but to allow states to make decisions that are suitable to their own conditions.

The law was enacted due to strong public concerns, and the three strikes provision plays a minor but very necessary role in juvenile justice in Western Australia. It applies to a small number of repeat offenders and to home burglary convictions within a two-year period. The Young Offenders Act 1994 aims to promote the best interests of the child, to encourage parents to accept their responsibility and to protect the community from illegal behaviour. There are a wide range of sentencing options to enable the courts to make orders that address the needs of both the young offender and the community. Police cautioning and juvenile justice teams in Western Australia have resulted in a decline in the number of charges dealt with in the Children's Court. The number of children admitted to detention centres has also declined during that period. Since the introduction of the legislation we have seen a decrease in the number of young people appearing before the court. \"]\n",

We are reliably informed that the Prime Minister was moved by the experience. He was emotional. He was determined to do something about the removal and decline of services to the bush. The trouble with Mr Howard's new found interest in the bush is that wanting to do something about the drain of brains, businesses, services and population in regional Australia is not the same as doing it. What regional Australia is still experiencing is often the result of this government's policies, and they do not look like changing the menu. Promises are not matched with reality. Let us have a look at some examples. In the lead-up to the 1998 federal election, Treasurer Peter Costello promised that the GST would not lead to an increase in petrol prices. Now the promise has been watered down; it is limited and is conditional. That no conditions were imposed in 1998, that no limits were suggested and that no differentiation had been made between `core' and `non-core' promises seem not to worry Mr Costello. It is quite clear that the Treasurer's Sydney based price of 77c a litre for petrol means that in areas where the base price exceeds this there will be a price rise once the GST is imposed.\"]\n",

In his bush bash, the Prime Minister offered two responses to the plight of regional Australians: stop the withdrawal of government services and ease the suffering by selling the rest of Telstra and using the money to provide more infrastructure and services. But, Prime Minister, many in the bush already regard the sale of Telstra as a disaster, believing it not only symbolises the withdrawal of federal government services from the regions, but that since privatisation began communication services have diminished. This is clearly a bribe. The Prime Minister has no coherent regional policy or policies to tackle the inequalities facing regional Australia. For example, the government is now using part of the 16 per cent Telstra sell-off to fund a TV black spot program. It will not be enough and it should not rely on the sale of valuable public assets.

The aim of this program is to do an audit of tourism facilities in the Blue Mountains to list those which have access and are accessible for people with disabilities and people restricted to wheelchairs and then to promote and advertise to the community of people with disabilities the tourism facilities in the Blue Mountains. The aim of the project is to target those people who do not have easy accesssenior citizens, people with disabilitiesto make it easier for them to visit the Blue Mountains. The Blue Mountains already serve people with disabilities well, but a lot of people do not know about it. The aim of this particular program is to do an audit and then to promote throughout the community what we have in the Blue Mountains.\"]\n",
      "['Tourism in the Blue Mountains is already a tremendous job generator. We have almost 1,900 jobs directly related to tourism in the Blue Mountains, roughly 5,000 jobs indirectly related to tourism and around 1.3 to 1.5 million visitor nights a year generating around $100 million a year to the local economy. What we are wanting to do with this program is to develop a niche tourism program by attracting many others who would like to come to the Blue Mountains and who do not know how friendly and accessible it is for people with disabilities, and to advertise what we have and then encourage them to come. ']\n",
      "['It is estimated that in the US alone there are 10 to 12 million people with physical disabilities. It is estimated that throughout the developed world there are close to 40 million people in wheelchairs. There is an enormous untapped market of people with disabilities and people with restricted access who would like to have access to tourism facilities, who would certainly love to visit tremendous places like the Blue Mountains but do not know what it has to offer and do not know that it is actually very accessible to them. So this exciting project is aiming to develop and promote what we have in the Blue Mountains.']\n",
      "['With the Paralympics coming up late this year, this will be an ideal time to market what we have there. I would like to congratulate Noel Heffernan, who is on the Blue Mountains access committee and is an advocate for people with disabilities, for his vision and for the work he is already doing with this exciting project. It will be a great benefit for people with disabilities and it will be a great benefit for tourism and hospitality businesses in the Blue Mountains.']\n",
      "['The second particular project was the launch late last year of the Blue Mountains Business Network. We have scattered throughout the mountains many small chambers of commerce and many small business associations, but up until now they have all been acting reasonably independently. The $80,000 grant that the federal government contributed late last year has enabled us to set up a regional chamber of commerceto develop a united Blue Mountains chamber of commerce. Through the Blue Mountains Business Network, they can act together. They can network, they can exchange business, they can work at keeping business in the Blue Mountains and they can lobby governments of all levels more effectively. Through doing this they can promote business in the Blue Mountains.']\n",
      "[\"Mr Speaker, these two projects are very exciting. They are both funded by the federal government and between them represent $165,000, showing this government's commitment to small business in the Blue Mountains and its commitment to generating jobs in the Blue Mountains. I am very excited about the prospects and I look forward to the growth in prosperity as a result of these two projects. The fundamentals are right for job growth in the mountains. This government has done a lot and is continuing to do a lot, through sound economic management, through low interest rates and through strong and sustainable economic growth, to ensure that small business not only survives but thrives and continues to generate jobs. These two projects, particularly for the Blue Mountains, will make sure that we capitalise on that.\"]\n",

      "['Mr Speaker, earlier today you announced to the House the unfortunate death on 19 December last year of Mr Brendan Hansen, who was the member for Wide Bay and the whip in the Whitlam government. Mr Hansen was 77 years of age and had an illustrious career in this parliament and in the Queensland parliament, as well as on the Maryborough City Council. He was one of only two Labor members ever to represent the electorate of Wide Bay in this parliament. He was in very good company in that the other Labor member to represent Wide Bay was the three times Prime Minister of Australia, Andrew Fisher, who was the second Labor Prime Minister of this country after John Watson, after whom my own electorate was called. Brendan had worked in the shipyards in Maryborough. He was a shipwright by trade, as indeed his father was before him. He was a member of the Maryborough City Council and, after he left this parliament, where he served from 1961 to 1972, he became a member of the Queensland parliament, where he represented the electorate of Maryborough from 1977 to 1983. There are not many people who get the privilege of representing the three levels of elected office in this country, and Brendan Hansen was one of those.  ']\n",
      "[\"As I said, Brendan had an illustrious career. He was not one of those people who came in here with a field marshal's baton in his knapsack. A friend of mine, Di Ford, who was his clerk when he was the whip and who, in the last Labor government, worked for a number of ministers here and for me when I was the government whip for part of that time, used to often say to me, `Brendan would have done this,' or `Brendan would have done that.' Being the government whip between 1972 and 1974 certainly would have been an active job. Brendan came into this parliament in 1961 in that credit squeeze election which nearly saw the Menzies government tipped out. Indeed, being a Queenslander he would have been very aware of the fact that Jim Killen was elected on Communist Party preferences, and that was what got Menzies over the line. So Queensland have a lot to answer for in terms of that election. \"]\n",
      "[\"As I said, Brendan was a shipwright and his father was a shipwright before him. In those days, for him in the 1960s and for his father in the 1940s, a shipwright was a person in a very significant trade. A shipwright and an electrician were at the top of their trades. They were people who made things with their hands and who got things done. Brendan's interest in the mercantile industry showed in his maiden speech. In a number of parts of that speech he talks about the government's policy on shipbuilding. Indeed, at one stage he said:\"]\n",
      "['He goes on to talk, at another stage, about the government purchasing the Charles F. Adams type destroyers and he also talks about the government purchasing British minesweepers, which he said could have certainly been built in the yards in Brisbane and Maryborough, as well as in those other shipyards up and down the Queensland coast.']\n",
      "['It is interesting to read in his maiden speech about the attitudes of people of that time. But it should go on the record that Brendan Hansen was a person who represented his electorate, his family and his country well. In his death notice it was said that his wife, Moira, and his family fondly remembered him and that, in lieu of flowers, a donation should be made to the Heart Foundation or the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. That probably summed up what Brendan Hansen was about and it is important that we should put on the record tonight an idea of his service. I am pleased to see that the minister who is currently the member for Wide Bay will be saying something about him as well.']\n",

      "['Mr Speaker, at the most recent Sydney Airport Community Forum I expressed my grave concern at the inability or unwillingness of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to implement the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport. On 28 May last year at the forum I moved a motion that was carried unanimously by SACF calling on the minister to direct Airservices Australia to implement a project schedule for the full and complete implementation of the long-term operating plan. To date, this project schedule has not been done. This motion provided a detailed summary of what the schedule was to contain. On 4 February we had the farcical situation of Airservices Australia giving a presentation and tabling a summary of progress which was a response to my motion and which in no way complied with the motion that was called for last May. In fact, it showed that, in the time since that motion was passed, air traffic movements to the north have gotten worseand we had Airservices saying that aircraft movements to the north have improved considerably. ']\n",
      "['The reality is that aircraft movements to the south of Sydney Harbourthat is, the electorates of Lowe, Grayndler, Watson and Sydneyhave got considerably worse. Quite plainly, Minister Anderson must be brought in and must force Airservices Australia to comply with those motions that are passed by SAFC to see the full implementation of the long-term operating plan and, moreover, to make a decision about the second airport for Sydney. Quite frankly, until we get a decision for a second airportand Badgerys Creek looks like the only realistic optionthe residents in my electorate of Lowe and indeed Sydney are going to suffer. This is totally unacceptable. For the minister to allow Airservices Australia to say that things are getting better is just lies. ']\n",

      "['I thank the House for granting me this courtesy to add to the comments of the Chief Opposition Whip in tribute to Brendan Hansen, who was member for Wide Bay for 13 years from 1961 to 1974. As the Chief Opposition Whip said, he was unique in that there have only ever been two Labor members for Wide Bay. Both served for significant terms, but he shares that honour with none other than Andrew Fisher, the distinguished early Australian Prime Minister.']\n",
      "[\"Traditionally, Wide Bay may well be regarded as a conservative seat, but it is also a place where there has always been a large working community. Brendan's own background was as a shipwright working in Walkers shipyards, one of the premier industries of Maryborough at that time, and he had, in many senses, a classical Labor Party upbringing. He was involved in the shipbuilding industry, he was active in the union movement and he took a keen interest in local affairs, but he was largely unknown when he was elected in 1961 to the seat of Wide Bay. He served in that electorate with a great deal of distinction and was loved by his constituency. He was able to hold the seat, I think, because of his strong personal following and the very strong view in the community that he was a traditional, decent man who took the time to be interested in his constituents and was always involved in community activities.\"]\n",
      "[\"Brendan was respected across party lines. I have many happy personal stories of my own memories. I regarded him as a personal friend, even though we were obviously always opposed when it came to election time. Brendan was active in the Labor Party right until his death. Indeed, he was described quite rightly as the godfather of the Labor Party in Maryborough, in the kindest possible way. He was also active in many community organisations, particularly welfare organisations, right up until his last days. He was one of those who initially started Labour Day celebrations in Maryborough. There aren't many towns left in Australia that have Labour Day celebrations, but Maryborough is one of them. Brendan was involved in those for more than 40 years. It is perhaps ironic that the decline in his health began when he collapsed at a May Day march a couple of years ago.\"]\n",
      "['Amongst my earliest memories of Brendan was when he came to my little country town of Kumbia to attend a rural youth dinner. Brendan would have polled about 20 votes out of 400 in Kumbia but he still came all that way to the most distant part of his electorate to be involved with young people at a rural youth annual dinner. Subsequent to that time we got to know one another through various activities with which we were jointly involved.']\n",
      "[\"Brendan was defeated in the 1974 election, the mid-term Whitlam election, by Clarrie Millar, who then served in this House with distinction for 15 years. Brendan and Clarrie remained friends. In fact, one of my other happy memories of Brendan was at a tribute function that I organised for Clarrie Millar when he retired from this parliament. Amongst the people who paid their money to come to pay tribute to Clarrie was Brendan Hansen. I think that again reflected the community spirit and the goodwill that Brendan always engendered. In fact, I have a photograph that I treasure of Brendan, Clarrie and me taken in the Great Hall one 9 May when he came down for those celebrations. I even published it in my newsletter under the title `The three members'. It was a demonstration, again, of his good spiritedness and willingness to be involved and interested in the community. \"]\n",
      "[\"Brendan was baptised in St Mary's Catholic Church in Maryborough. He was married in that church. He was chairman of the finance committee and was responsible for raising a very large amount of money, when the church was in danger of collapse, for its restoration and then, appropriately, he was buried from that church, a church that he loved very dearly. There were many famous people at his funeral, as one would expect: Gough Whitlam; Manfred Cross, who presented the eulogy; and Tom Burns. People like Clarrie Millar and those from the other side of politics were there because of the way in which he engendered such community support and appreciation.\"]\n",
      "['It is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution of his family. Brendan was 38 years of age before he married but still had time for eight children—eight very talented and artistic children. Indeed, over recent years I met Brendan and Moira Hansen perhaps most often at art shows and the like when he was there collecting prizes on behalf of his daughters, because they were prolifically successful. On the day of the funeral four of his daughters sang Ave Maria magnificently. It was quite a moving experience for the whole church. This very talented family has contributed greatly to the community.']\n",
      "[\"Brendan experienced the euphoria of Labor's great win when Gough Whitlam came to power. He was the first Labor government whip for decades but, unfortunately, he lasted only a short period. He was defeated in the mid-term election but then went on to serve in the state parliament and also had a period in local government. I conclude with a couple of comments that Nancy Bates, the editor of the Maryborough Chronicle, wrote on the day of his funeral:\"]\n",
      "['Brendan Hansen served Maryborough, he served Wide Bay, he served Australia, with great distinction. Personally, I admired him greatly. Maryborough is certainly the poorer for his passing. Vale, Brendan. Well done. We extend our sympathies to Moira and his family and commend them also on their contribution to the community.']\n",
